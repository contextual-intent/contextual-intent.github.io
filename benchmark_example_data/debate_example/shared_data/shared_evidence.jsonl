Current political and economic issues succinctly explained.\nImmigration has historically driven U.S. growth and filled labor shortages in various sectors, but it has also remained one of the most politically divisive issues. In the modern era, successive administrations have agreed on the need to reform the asylum system and bolster border security, while differing sharply on how to manage immigration more broadly.\nSince returning to office in 2025, President Donald Trump has reversed many of his predecessor\u2019s policies and followed through on a campaign promise to crack down on both legal and unauthorized immigration. This has reignited the debate over the economic role of immigrants in the U.S. labor market.\n#### Do immigrants contribute to U.S. economic growth?\nImmigrants\u2014totaling almost 48 million out of a population of roughly 335 million people\u2014generated about $1.7 trillion in economic activity in 2023, according to an of the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey that year. They also paid roughly $652 billion in local, state, and federal taxes.\nUndocumented immigrants, meanwhile, held $299 billion in spending power in 2023, and undocumented households had a combined income of nearly $389 billion\u2014paying close to $90 billion in taxes. Still, proponents of immigration restriction have argued that undocumented immigrants in particular are a , especially on state and local budgets, which bear a large portion of the costs such as education and health-care costs for a larger population.", "Most economists say that immigration is good for the U.S. economy because it helps grow the size of the labor force, boost tax revenue, and increase consumer demand. There is some debate about the effect of immigration on wages, however. Some researchers, such as Harvard University\u2019s George Borjas, have about its negative impact on the . Others, such as economist Giovanni Peri, [PDF] that immigration has only a minimal effect on the wages of U.S.-born workers. \n#### How many immigrants work in the United States?\nNearly thirty-one million immigrants worked in the United States in 2024, accounting for [PDF] of the U.S. civilian workforce, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The U.S. foreign-born population had a labor force participation rate of nearly 67 percent, compared to roughly 62 percent for the U.S.-born workforce. (The BLS definition of foreign-born includes legally admitted immigrants, refugees, temporary residents, and undocumented immigrants.)\n#### Which industries employ the most immigrant workers?\nImmigrants work across a wide range of industries and occupations. Compared with those born in the United States, greater shares of immigrants work in service occupations (22 percent); natural resources, construction, and maintenance (13.9 percent); and production, transportation, and material moving (15.5 percent), according to the BLS. \nA 2025 found that 18.5 percent of immigrant workers participate in the gig economy as their primary or secondary job.

The administration has contended that these workers are available to counter labor shortages. \u201cThere is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.\nHowever, economists caution that a shrinking labor force could have long-term economic effects. The administration\u2019s enforcement policies could decrease the amount of goods and services produced domestically\u2014a major component of gross domestic product (GDP). This could cut annual economic growth by almost one-third by 2035, according to an [PDF] by the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP). \u201cImmigrants both create demand for the goods and services produced by U.S.-born workers and work alongside them in ways that increase productivity for both groups,\u201d said Mark Regets, a senior fellow at NFAP.\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics, meanwhile, [PDF] in 2024 that deporting between 1.3 and 8.3 million undocumented immigrants would reduce U.S. real GDP by as much as 7 percent by 2028 while significantly decreasing U.S. employment, increasing inflation, and driving down demand. Still, economic analyses widely suggest that the administration\u2019s actions, especially mass deportations and restrictions on legal immigration pathways, will have a negative effect on long-term U.S. economic growth.\n_Will Merrow helped create the graphics for this article_.\nThis work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) License.\n###  Explore More on United States", "Immigrants have long played a critical role in the U.S. economy, filling labor gaps, driving innovation, and exercising consumer spending power.

As a result, immigrants have made up [a growing share of the nation\u2019s workers](https://econofact.org/immigration-and-waning-us-labor-force-growth). The impact of immigrant workers is large at both the low- and high-skill ends of the labor force. Immigrants represent a high share of workers in many low-wage, manual labor sectors of the economy. At the same time, immigrants contribute importantly to high-level technical skills and entrepreneurial energy. Most recently, however, government policies have aimed at drastically curtailing the inflow of immigrants and increasing the outflows of foreign-born persons. What are the different ways that this shift might impact the US economy?\n> The recent decline in immigration could adversely affect the economy through multiple channels, short term and long term.", "* High rates of immigration have driven a fivefold increase in theliving in the United States over the past six decades. All told, the number of immigrants rose to 53.3 million in January 2025 (about 15.8 percent of the population), up from under 10 million in 1965 (about 5 percent of the population). High rates of immigration in part reflected legislation in the 1960s that opened pathways to legal immigration to a much wider and diverse set of countries. Since 2000, the population of highly-educated foreign-born workers grew at an especially strong rate, as they were well-placed to obtain permanent residence status and then naturalization (see ). More recently, since 2021, there was a sharp increase in the population of unauthorized immigrants (those without full legal status, which includes people who entered the United States illegally and people who were allowed to enter through the use of parole authority and who may be awaiting proceedings in immigration court.) As COVID-related restrictions on border crossings were eased, many immigrants received temporary paroles or deportation protection as asylum seekers, victims of crime and violence, and refugees from countries facing war and natural disasters. The estimated population of unauthorized immigrants jumped from 10.2 million in 2019 to a record high of [Looking at the 2023 foreign-born population](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/08/21/key-findings-about-us-immigrants/) (the last year for which complete data is available), 46 percent were naturalized U.S. citizens, 27 percent were lawful residents with permanent or temporary residence permits, and 27 percent were without full legal status (of which 40 percent had parole or some other form of protected status).", "* However, recent shifts in government policies have led to a sharp reversal in net immigration flows, as the number of new immigrants has been sharply curtailed and aggressive actions have been taken to repatriate unauthorized immigrants living in the United States. The annual net flow of immigrants peaked at 3.4 million people in 2023, far above the previous peak of over 1.5 million in 2014 (see chart). Starting in mid-2024, however, entries through the various asylum and parole programs were limited by the Biden administration. Since January 2025, the [Trump administration has gone further](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/immigration-policy-and-its-macroeconomic-effects-in-the-second-trump-administration/) in removing deportation protections, rescinding work permits, stopping accepting asylum applications, halting the release of immigrants encountered at the border, while intensifying repatriation efforts of unauthorized immigrants living in the United States. There is a high degree of uncertainty in the estimates for net immigration flows for 2025. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 2025 that net immigration would still be positive but drop sharply to 0.4 million (see chart). Other estimates suggest a decline of foreign-born people living in the United States. For instance, according to a Pew Research Center , the total number of foreign-born persons living in the United States dropped by over 1.4 million from January 2025 to July 2025, although the [decline may be exaggerated by](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/seeing-economic-data-through-fog-immigration-estimates) increasing reluctance of unauthorized immigrants to participate in population surveys.", "* As the share of foreign-born workers has risen, variations in net immigration rates have substantial consequences for the U.S. workforce. Since 1995, the population of foreign-born workers has grown 2.8 percent per year and the native born by only 0.6 percent per year. In consequence, net immigration has accounted for close to half of labor force growth, pushing the share of foreign-born workers up to 19.2 percent of the work force in 2024 from under 12 percent in 1995 (). The growing importance of immigrants in the labor force is a result of immigration trends, but it is also a reflection of the [increasing retirement of the baby boom generation](https://leowealth.com/insights/what-is-the-impact-of-accelerating-baby-boomer-retirements/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20is%20witnessing%20an,to%20roughly%2058%25%20by%202030.)", "* A sharp slowing or even reversal of the growth of the U.S. labor force would have a significant negative impact on employment and GDP growth. The speed at which the economy can grow over a longer horizon is determined by changes in the total amount people are working \u2014 which involves both the number of workers in the labor force and the hours they work \u2014 and the efficiency with which they produce goods and services. Estimates of the negative impact of a reduction of labor force growth on GDP growth depend on the assumptions made on the drop in net migration, but the order of magnitude is similar across studies. A recent AEI  of this impact was based on projections that the net change in the population of immigrants over age 16 will be in the range of -525,000 to 115,000 in 2025, down from 2.2 million in 2024. The analysis suggested that this shift would reduce GDP growth in 2025 by 0.3 - 0.4 percentage points as potential growth in employment is cut from 140,000-180,000 jobs a month in 2024 to 10,000-40,000 jobs a month in the second half of 2025.

We project that deportation also reduces wages of high-skill workers, compromising 63% of workers. Still, can see their wages increase but only if the deportation policy is permanently sustained after 4 years. Even with new funds provided in the 2025 OBBBA, we estimate that permanent deportation would cost an additional $900 billion over the first 10 years. \n  * We examine two distinct policy scenarios regarding the deportation of unauthorized immigrants: (i) A 4-year policy where 10 percent of unauthorized immigrants are removed annually over four years (2025 \u2013 2028), with unauthorized immigration returning to baseline levels in 2029; (ii) A 10-year policy where 10 percent of unauthorized immigrants are removed each year for a period of ten years, ultimately removing all unauthorized immigrants and preventing the entry of new unauthorized immigrants thereafter. In both scenarios, immigration laws concerning authorized workers remain unchanged.\n  * The 4-year policy would increase primary deficits by about before economic feedback effects and $350 billion with economic feedback effects. The 10-year policy would cost about before economic feedback effects and $987 billion with economic feedback effects. Besides lost revenue, these primary deficits include new required outlays that are in addition to the monies (about $170 billion) already allocated in the 2025 OBBBA for border security, interior enforcement, and deportation.", "* Not surprisingly, most aggregate economic variables fall. By 2034, the 4-year policy reduces GDP by 1.0 percent; the 10-year policy reduces it by 3.3 percent. By 2054, the 4-year policy reduces real GDP by 1.0 percent; the 10-year policy reduces it by 4.9 percent. But economic variables also mostly decline, including a fall in the wage of 0.5 percent (4-year policy) and 1.7 percent (10-year policy). Output per capita also falls between 0.5 percent and 1.1 percent.\n  * However, the impact on wages varies by skill class. High-skilled workers, which compromise 63% of the working population, would see their wages fall over time by 0.5 percent or $494 per year for the 4-year policy, and by 2.8 percent or $2,764 for the 10-year policy. But wages for authorized (including US-born) low-skilled workers can increase. Under the 4-year policy, their wages increase by 1.1 percent by 2034 but eventually fall 0.6 percent by 2054. Under the 10-year policy, their wages increase by 5.0 percent by 2034 and mostly persist thereafter. As a result, for the median authorized low-skilled workers born today, these changes translate into lifetime losses of around $8,600 (4-year policy) to lifetime gains of $63,600 (10-year policy). Overall, while a permanent deportation policy can benefit low-income workers, reversals can leave low-income workers worse off over time as higher debt decreases wages.", "A considers just the impact of deportation on the Social Security program.\n# Mass Deportation of Unauthorized Immigrants: Fiscal and Economic Effects\nThe United States currently has over 11 million unauthorized immigrants, equal to about 3.4 percent of the total population, who disproportionately occupy low-skilled jobs. Jobs held by unauthorized immigrants are largely complementary to jobs of authorized workers. Policies that deport unauthorized immigrants, therefore, generally harm high-skilled workers. However, jobs held by unauthorized immigrants are imperfect substitutes for low-skilled workers. Still, overall, policies that deport unauthorized immigrants generally help low-skilled workers at reasonable values of elasticity of substitution. \nIn this brief, we analyze two deportation policy scenarios: \ni) 10 percent of unauthorized immigrants are removed annually for four years (2025 \u2013 2028) and unauthorized immigration is halted over this period with enhanced spending on border security. The annual net flow of unauthorized immigration returns to baseline levels in 2029. \nii) 10 percent of unauthorized immigrants are removed each year for a period of ten years, ultimately removing all unauthorized immigrants by the end of 2034. Enhanced spending on border security prevents unauthorized immigration during the first 10 years and beyond. \nIn both scenarios, immigration laws concerning authorized workers remain unchanged. \nWithout the mass deportation policies, including those policies in the 2025 OBBBA, Table 1 shows that the population is projected to rise from 337.2 million at the end of 2025 to 379 million by 2054, with the number of unauthorized immigrants projected to increase from 11.5 million in 2025 to 12.3 million in \nTable 1: Change in Population Sizes under the Deportation Policies \nDifference in the total population relative to current-law baseline  \nDifference in the unauthorized-immigrant population relative to current-law baseline", "Difference in the total population relative to current-law baseline  \nDifference in the unauthorized-immigrant population relative to current-law baseline  \nNote: Numbers reflect end-of-year values. The decrease in the total population is smaller than the decrease in the unauthorized population because, once unauthorized immigrants leave the United States, they no longer have U.S.-born children who would have added to the overall count. Source: Penn Wharton Budget Model \nUnder the 4-year deportation scenario, the total U.S. population decreases by 1.2 million in the first year and by 5 million by the end of 2028. As the annual flow of unauthorized immigration returns to current-law levels in 2029, the gap gradually narrows; by 2054, the population is only 3.7 million smaller than the baseline. Much of this difference reflects timing rather than permanence, as some unauthorized immigrants deported under the policy would have emigrated voluntarily by 2054 even under current law. Additionally, the gap between the unauthorized immigrant population and the total population at the end of 2054 also accounts for the number of \"missing\" U.S.-born children\u2014births that do not occur because their immigrant parents were removed and are no longer present in the U.S. \nThe 10-year deportation scenario results in larger and enduring demographic changes. The population falls by 5.0 million by the end of 2028, falls by 12.8 million by 2034, and falls by 18.8 million by 2054. Almost 12.3 million of the 18.8 million reduction is due to the reduction in unauthorized immigrants.\nHousehold Statuses and Program Access\nTo analyze the policy\u2019s impact on different populations, we categorize households into three distinct groups based on their education levels and legal status.", "* are native-born citizens, permanent residents, and visa-holding immigrants who have at least some college education.

The slowdown in unauthorized immigrant inflows will have important implications for growth of the labor force and economy and may impact wages and prices. Increases in the foreign-born population accounted for[ most labor force and population growth](https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Immigrants-and-Americas-Labor-Force-Growth.NFAP-Policy-Brief.2024.pdf) in recent years.

This methodology allows us to consider several scenarios for the future evolution of unauthorized immigration, including a mass-deportation scenario in which the number of people removed from the country annually rises to 1 million by year-end 2027.", "The identification of the model builds on insights from previous studies that show migration responds to changes in economic pull factors with a delay. [Conditions in the home country](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.37.1.199) and unexpected changes in immigration enforcement also play important roles in migration. This evidence suggests immigration inflows can be treated as predetermined with respect to U.S. macroeconomic conditions within the same year. \nOur estimates show that an unexpected increase in net unauthorized immigration raises U.S. output growth for about two years but has almost no effect on inflation. Applying these estimates to our baseline policy scenario, which assumes that net unauthorized immigration remains at its spring 2025 level, annual GDP growth is about 0.8 percentage point lower than it would have been if net unauthorized immigration would have evolved as in the The CBO estimates reflect the laws and policies in place in November 2024 and, hence, do not incorporate immigration policy changes after January 2025. \nThe baseline scenario represents about a 2.4 million decline in net unauthorized immigration during 2025\u201328 relative to the CBO projection. In a mass-deportation scenario with a larger decline, the negative effect on growth is about the same magnitude but more persistent. \nThe VAR model estimates are robust to the sample period, the lag order and alternative model specifications. However, there are several caveats. First, the predicted effects are highly uncertain, as the estimates have large error bands that include zero in many cases.", "Second, the VAR model estimates used for the scenario analysis are based on data from 1955 to 2019. The economy has evolved significantly over this period and since the pandemic. As a result, the historical relationship between variables such as migration and GDP may not adequately capture their relationship in the postpandemic period. Moreover, time-varying effects of immigration or other possible nonlinearities could bias our estimates in an unknown direction. \nThird, our results only speak to the potential effects of restricting unauthorized immigration, which may be quite different from the effects of restricting legal immigration. Given these caveats, readers should be aware of the uncertainty around our estimates, especially regarding immigration\u2019s effects on GDP growth. \n## Unauthorized immigration: past, present and future\nThe boom and bust of unauthorized immigration since 2021 \nTo create a measure of net unauthorized immigration, we use data from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to add up unauthorized migrant inflows and subtract outflows. The result is a time series of monthly net unauthorized immigration from October 2013 to March 2025 (). \nThe DHS data utilized to construct inflows include information on encounters with unauthorized immigrants along the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada and in the interior. The data also include Border Patrol estimates of the number of immigrants who illegally entered the U.S. along the borders and got away (eluded capture), a flow called \u201cgotaways\u201d by DHS. For outflows, we utilize migrant repatriations (removals and returns at the borders and the interior). Hence, net unauthorized immigration totals nationwide migrant encounters and border gotaways as a measure of the inflow and subtracts repatriations as a measure of the outflow.", "Net unauthorized immigration was very low during 2013\u201318, as Chart 1 shows. It spiked in 2019 due to a surge in migration from Central America before falling sharply in 2020, as the borders shut down in response to the coronavirus outbreak. \nOnce the borders reopened in late 2021, net unauthorized immigration rose dramatically, reaching a historical high in late 2023, before once more falling in 2024. The decline accelerated in June 2024, as the Biden administration began restricting certain migrants\u2019 ability to request asylum along the southern border. By March 2025, net unauthorized immigration was down 82 percent from the December 2024 level\u2014from 105,000 to 19,000 per month. \nTo evaluate the macroeconomic effects of the future evolution of net unauthorized immigration, we construct migration scenarios that speak to the current administration\u2019s two major policy goals. The first is to stop unauthorized immigration at the border, canceling humanitarian parole and essentially suspending the asylum-seeking process. The second goal is to conduct mass deportations from the interior of the country. \nNet unauthorized immigration is therefore decomposed into two components. The is the sum of encounters and gotaways minus repatriations that occur at the borders, and the is deportations of people arrested in the U.S. interior. \nGiven the progress in stopping immigration along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, we expect the border-inflow component of net unauthorized immigration to remain near zero as it has in recent months. The path of the interior-outflow component, however, is uncertain.

Employer payrolls increased only by 115,000 jobs, following a gain of 154,000 last month and average increases of 252,000 per month in the three prior months. At last month\u2019s pace of job growth, increases in employment are roughly keeping up with increases in new labor market entrants and the unemployment rate was little changed at 8.1 percent. \nU.S. immigration policy continues to be a key issue of debate among federal and state policymakers alike. In that debate, one area of disagreement has been the impact of immigration on the U.S. labor force and the wages of American workers\u2014particularly during today\u2019s difficult economic times. In fact, because of the weak labor market immigration flows have changed dramatically since the start of the Great Recession\u2014the undocumented population has declined (; ), and the number of high-skilled H-1B visas being issued was down by over 25 percent in 2010 from a 2001 peak (). As the economy continues to recover, however, it is likely that demand for immigrant labor by American businesses and the desire of immigrants to work in the United States will continue to rise. The ability of our immigration system to respond to these demands remains an important economic policy issue, both in the short term and for our country\u2019s long-term growth strategy.", "In this month\u2019s employment analysis, we discuss the economic evidence on what immigration means for U.S. jobs and the economy in advance of The Hamilton Project\u2019s in Washington, DC. We also continue to update our analysis of the \u201cjobs gap,\u201d or the number of jobs that the U.S. economy needs to create in order to return to pre-recession employment levels, releasing an that allows readers to calculate when the country will close the jobs gap at different rates of job creation.\nThe Impact of Immigrants on Employment and Earnings\nAlthough many are concerned that immigrants compete against Americans for jobs, the most recent economic evidence suggests that, on average, immigrant workers increase the opportunities and incomes of Americans. Based on a survey of the academic literature, economists do not tend to find that immigrants cause any sizeable decrease in wages and employment of U.S.-born citizens (), and instead may raise wages and lower prices in the aggregate (; ; ). One reason for this effect is that immigrants and U.S.-born workers generally do not compete for the same jobs; instead, many immigrants complement the work of U.S. employees and increase their productivity. For example, low-skilled immigrant laborers allow U.S.-born farmers, contractors, and craftsmen to expand agricultural production or to build more homes\u2014thereby expanding employment possibilities and incomes for U.S. workers. Another way in which immigrants help U.S. workers is that businesses adjust to new immigrants by opening stores, restaurants, or production facilities to take advantage of the added supply of workers; more workers translate into more business.", "Because of these factors, economists have found that immigrants slightly raise the average wages of all U.S.-born workers. As illustrated by the right-most set of bars in the chart below, estimates from opposite ends of the academic literature arrive at this same conclusion, and point to small but positive wage gains of between 0.1 and 0.6 percent for American workers.\nBut while immigration improves living standards on average, the economic literature is divided about whether immigration reduces wages for certain groups of workers. In particular, some estimates suggest that immigration has reduced the wages of low-skilled workers and college graduates. This research, shown by the blue bars in the chart above, implies that the influx of immigrant workers from 1990 to 2006 reduced the wages of low-skilled workers by 4.7 percent and college graduates by 1.7 percent. However, other estimates that examine immigration within a different economic framework (the red bars in the chart) find that immigration raises the wages of all U.S. workers\u2014regardless of the immigrants\u2019 level of education.\nA Path Forward with An Economic Approach to Immigration Reform\nOur current immigration system has myriad challenges: dozens of overlapping visa categories\u2014each with different quotas, costs, and durations\u2014characterize the system of legal immigration, supplemented by country-specific caps, and even a randomized visa lottery. As a result, the system is plagued by problems, ranging from its cumbersome and costly application systems, to its inefficient ability to meet the needs of American families and an ever-changing economy. One measure of the inefficiency is the thousands of dollars in legal fees that many visa applicants must spend.", "In a forthcoming discussion paper for The Hamilton Project, \u201cImmigration Policies for Jobs, Productivity, and Growth,\u201d University of California, Davis, Professor Giovanni Peri puts forward one approach to immigration reform that focuses on addressing economic concerns about the U.S. immigration system. Peri\u2019s proposal has several steps, ranging from reforms of the current system to a wholesale restructuring. The first step of his proposal is to introduce a market-based auction system to allocate existing temporary employment visas. Rather than waiting in line to bring a worker into the country as an employer would do in the current system, employers would bid on a permit to sponsor that worker in an auction. Revenues from the auctions could be used to run the system and to compensate the state and local governments that have the largest fiscal burdens from immigration. The discussion paper, which will be released on May 15, details the other steps and reforms.\nThe Hamilton Project continues its monthly analysis of how the \u201cjobs gap\u201d has evolved since the start of the Great Recession in December 2007. This month, the Hamilton Project updates its jobs blog analysis with a new interactive feature that allows readers to calculate how long the jobs gap will take to close under different rates of job creation. This interactive feature is available by .\nAs of April, our nation faces a jobs gap of 11.2 million jobs. The solid line shows the net number of jobs lost since the Great Recession began.

Given a more optimistic rate of 321,000 jobs per month, which was the average monthly rate for the best year of job creation in the 1990s, the economy will reach pre-recession employment levels by June 2016\u2014not for another four years.

It is crystal clear that immigration expands U.S. gross domestic product and is good for growth. And immigration overall has led to better, not worse, wages and work opportunities for U.S.-born workers. Yet, it is also clear that when workers are denied full and equal labor and employment rights, as some immigrants are when their immigration status is used against them\u2014it makes immigrant workers\u2019 lives more precarious and can harm the people with whom they work side-by-side in the same industries.\nEven in the face of our unjust policy regime, immigration today provides numerous benefits to the U.S. economy. The nation could benefit even more, and the benefit could be shared more widely with a smarter set of immigration policies that benefit all workers.\nThe benefits are too often overlooked, and the challenges it poses for policymakers and U.S.-born workers are often grossly exaggerated. In this paper, we assess the evidence on immigration\u2019s effect on a number of economic outcomes given the policy status quo. We then go on to highlight how immigration status impacts wages and working conditions, and finally, offer recommendations on how to craft a better immigration policy regime\u2014one that grants immigrants their full rights as workers in U.S. labor markets, generating broad benefits for U.S. and foreign-born workers alike. Our key findings are:", "* Immigration is enabling economic growth despite the sharp deceleration in the growth of the U.S.-born workforce. Immigrants have risen as a share of the U.S. population in recent decades. Because immigrants are younger and more likely to be working age than the U.S.-born population, they have risen even faster as a share of the labor force. These trends are driven as much by the sharp deceleration of growth of the U.S.-born workforce as they are by a sharp increase in the absolute scale of immigration flows. Even when available data are adjusted to better reflect the notable increase in immigration in recent years, the growth of the foreign-born population since 2022 is not out of line with other historical periods (and is lower than what prevailed in the late 1990s). What unprecedented in recent years is the rapid deceleration of growth in the U.S.-born population\u2014a population that will soon start seeing outright contraction. Without immigration, the prime-age workforce (between the ages of 25 and 54) would have seen essentially no growth at all in the past quarter century, dramatically constricting the ability to grow our economy and staff key industries.", "* Immigration does not reduce the number of jobs available for U.S.-born workers and has provided a source of deflationary pressure in recent years. Macroeconomic policymakers like the Federal Reserve and Congress have both the necessary tools and the obligation to ensure that demand in the economy is strong enough to absorb willing workers in a reasonable amount of time. Historical periods when job opportunities become scarce were not driven by increased immigration flows but instead by the failures of macroeconomic policymakers to respond in a timely fashion to weakness in demand for labor. Immigration flows generally do not make policymakers\u2019 task of matching macroeconomic supply and demand any harder because immigrants add to both economywide supply (by increasing labor supply) and demand (by buying goods and services). Overall, immigrants likely tilt this balance more toward supply relative to U.S.-born workers, but only by a bit. This net supply increase is sometimes quite useful\u2014by boosting supply a bit more than demand over the 2021\u20132023 period, immigration provided a source of deflationary pressure that helped bring inflation down in those years, while also assisting in preventing a recession.", "* Immigration\u2019s effects on U.S. wages overall range from neutral to slightly positive. Immigrant workers tend to complement rather than substitute for U.S.-born workers of similar educational levels. The educational mix of immigrants is much more similar to that of U.S.-born workers than is often recognized, hence limiting the scope for competition from immigrants to lower wages for any U.S.-born workers of any particular educational background. Additionally, while the overall wage effects from immigration are neutral to slightly positive for U.S.-born workers, it is true that our flawed immigration policy regime often sees employers use the precariousness of some immigrant workers to suppress wage growth in particular sectors. Immigration reforms that remove this precariousness would aid the wage growth of both immigrants and the U.S.-born workers they work alongside in these labor markets."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "c4a6aac9-3990-5af6-8c32-92e177ed01ed", "url": "https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2025/immigration-cant-explain-declining-employment-growth", "title": "Immigration can't explain declining employment growth", "excerpts": ["# Immigration can\u2019t explain declining employment growth\nBroadly slowing labor market is a major factor in falling jobs numbers\nJake MacDonald/Minneapolis Fed; Getty Images\n  * Declining net immigration accounts for 40 to 60 percent of recent drop in U.S. job growth\n  * States and sectors with more unauthorized workers see relatively payroll growth\n  * Real wage growth slowing more for low-income workers despite lower competition from immigrant labor", "Immigration can\u2019t explain declining employment growth\nA current challenge for policymakers is interpreting recent softness in the labor market. Relative to 2024, the U.S. labor market produced 156,000 fewer jobs per month from May to August of 2025. Here we present four pieces of evidence suggesting that this slowdown reflects both weakening labor demand as well as a decline in net migration. \nThe views cited in this article do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis or the Federal Reserve System.\n  1. Around half of the decline in monthly employment payroll growth is attributable to declining net immigration. A range of different computations attribute between 40 and 60 percent of the decline in nonfarm employment growth to slower net migration.\n  2. The decline in employment growth is broad-based and less pronounced in states and sectors with larger shares of unauthorized employment. The 10 states with nearly 70 percent of unauthorized workers employ more than half of American workers but account for less than half of the decline in employment growth. The six industry sectors that employ almost 80 percent of unauthorized workers also employ more than half of American workers but account for only 36 percent of the decline in employment growth.\n  3. Median real wage growth has halved, dropping by even more for workers who compete with unauthorized workers. A large decline in net migration might have muted effects on wages as labor demand and supply offset each other. However, median real wages in 2025 are growing at close to half the rate of 2023 and 2024 (1.7 times slower growth). This is more pronounced for low-wage workers (2.5 times slower), who might be expected to benefit the most from less competition from unauthorized workers.", "4. Finally, we find that the share of workers who are employed has declined while the share of people who are not in the labor force has increased. If a decline in net immigration was largely behind the decline in the level of employment, then we might expect the shares of workers in employment, nonemployment, and unemployment to remain steady. Instead, there is a clear shift away from employment and toward nonparticipation in the labor force, a sign of a generally discouraging hiring market.", "Throughout, we apply the to benchmark employment estimates released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in September 2025. We take the revision, divide by 12 months, and push this revision through data from April 2024 to the most recent data (August 2025). This approach assumes that the 2025 data require the same revisions. Note that this only differentially affects computation of changes in employment because we do not revise data from January to March 2024. Since estimates of benchmark revisions are not available for the employment statistics by state, we use the published data. \n## Declining immigration accounts for roughly half of slower job growth\nThe data that we want to explain is the decline in employment growth between 2024 and 2025. We compare all of 2024 with May\u2013August 2025. This allows changes in immigration policy to come into effect and to account for any lag in unauthorized workers finding jobs. \nIn 2024, average monthly nonfarm employment growth was . In May to August 2025, it was jobs, a decline in job growth of jobs per month. Our aim is to provide an estimate for the share of this 156,000 monthly decline that could be directly attributable to a decline in net migration of unauthorized individuals. \nFrom various angles, it is clear the labor market is weakening\u2014with recent immigration trends only partly responsible for falling job growth.\nTo do this requires three numbers: the decline in net immigration of unauthorized individuals, the share of these missing workers that would be 16 and over, and the share of these missing workers that could be expected to be working. We are interested in computing an upper bound, so throughout we will make assumptions that push toward a higher estimate and then return to consider how this estimate falls as more conservative assumptions are made.", "1. We use the U.S. Congressional Budget Office\u2019s (CBO) for the 2024 to 2025 slowdown in net immigration of individuals who are not in lawful permanent resident, student visa, or employment visa categories. This is individuals, or individuals per month when spread out evenly over 12 months. (CBO\u2019s estimate of the decline in net immigration is the largest we have found, and hence we use this as an upper bound and return to more conservative estimates below.)\n  2. These statistics pertain to individuals, not workers. To estimate employment, we need to compute the share of workers 16 and over and the share we may expect to be employed. In 2024, 99 percent of apprehensions [by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters) were either single adults (64 percent) or family units, which by definition include a child (35 percent).

We need to adjust for the share that we estimate is employed. The employment-to-population rate for individuals from the ages of 16 to 64 without a disability is around (roughly midway between the for men and women).

Bush Institute partnered to release this book containing an in-depth analysis of the correlation between immigration and economic growth. \nImmigration is thus a positive but also disruptive change. There are lots of historical examples of positive yet disruptive economic change. The Industrial Revolution displaced millions of farm workers and resulted in the great urban migrations and the birth of mega-cities to which we now ascribe all kinds of positive attributes, including creativity and innovation and higher wages. \nNo great change is without some short-term cost. What is costly in the long-term is preventing market forces from funneling resources to their best use. The adjustment of wages and prices to the changing demand and supply in the economy are the levers of capitalism that direct resources to their best allocation.\nImmigration has net benefits. The fact that it has some costs is not a reason to bar it, but rather to manage it. Mechanisms can be found to benefit from immigration\u2019s gains while making up for the losses of some workers. International trade has similar effects, and workers adversely affected by trade are eligible for federal programs such as Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n> Immigration has net benefits.

The state has benefited from the migration as have those who moved here.\nWould wages have been higher without the inflow of labor? Perhaps temporarily.

In 2009, immigrants accounted for 17% of the U.S. labor force, up from just over 5% in 1970. In California, immigrants accounted for nearly 37% of the labor force, up from 11% in 1970.\n  * Immigrants are now less likely to be unemployed than native-born workers. In 2009, 10% of immigrants in California reported being unemployed and seeking work, compared to 11% of native-born workers. Among workers without high school diplomas, immigrants are half as likely to be unemployed as natives (12% vs. 23%). Immigrant men are less likely than native-born men to be out of the labor force (9% vs. 15%), but immigrant women are more likely than native-born women to be out of the labor force (33% vs. 25%). In the hard-hit construction sector, the unemployment rate among immigrants was 15% compared to 19% for native-born workers. Among less-educated construction workers the disparity is even wider: 17% unemployment for immigrants vs. 30% for native-born.\n  * Immigrant workers\u2019 education levels tend to be at either extreme. Most immigrant labor market participants are either college educated or have not completed high school. In California, 26% of immigrants in the labor market have bachelor\u2019s degrees, compared with 35% of natives, and 35% of immigrants in the labor market do not have high school diplomas, compared with 7% of natives.

The manufacturing sector was the largest employer of immigrants in California in 2009 (15%). Thirty percent of immigrants without high school diplomas were employed in the construction and manufacturing sectors. By contrast, 36% of college-educated immigrants worked in two main service industries: professional, scientific and technical services and health care and social assistance.\n  * On average, immigrants earn less than native-born workers. Nationwide, the hourly wages of immigrants are 12% lower than the hourly wages of American-born workers. In California, the wage gap is much larger (26%). But for immigrants in California with college degrees the wage gap is much smaller (8%) than for those with high school diplomas or less (27%). On average, immigrant workers\u2019 wages do not catch up to native-born workers\u2019 wages over time. But they tend to grow at a faster rate initially, increasing as much as 9% more quickly than comparable native-born workers\u2019 wages over the first 10-15 years after migration.\n  * Immigrants are unlikely to drive down the wages of most Americans. Although debate remains, the vast majority of economic studies find that immigration has little or no effect on the wages of the average American worker. A estimates that in California, immigration between 1990 and 2004 caused a 4% real wage increase for the average native-born worker.

Additionally, because of U.S. industrial policies creating positions in targeted industries and an aging workforce tied to specific career paths, shortages are set to become more dire in the medium term. These shortages will affect the affordability of necessities, including housing, medical care, and groceries. The situation will worsen without a drastic increase in the number of available workers, and changes to U.S. immigration policy are the most effective pathways to that end. As policymakers face considerable domestic economic challenges, it is worth remembering that the country\u2019s best tool is letting the huddled masses in.\n> The U.S. labor market cooled in the first half of 2024, but critical sectors remain badly understaffed . . . shortages will affect the affordability of necessities, including housing, medical care, and groceries.\nThree main factors contribute to positive economic growth: people, capital, and technology. The upside hopes for growth-fostering technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing are significant, as are the expectations for future reductions in interest rates. But the labor market cannot be ignored. Moreover, given how tight the U.S. labor market is, there are signs that it is contributing to inflation and hindering U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth. While hiring rates are slowing and the overall tightness of the labor market may unwind, the labor shortage described in the following four case studies remains acute. The sectors explored in these case studies are central to U.S. prosperity, which is why ameliorating these shortages will be key to continued U.S. economic growth.", "To help the U.S. economy achieve its greatest potential, jobs must be filled. Physically demanding in-person roles are facing shortfalls, including in construction, healthcare, transportation, and food production. These demanding roles could be filled with increases in legal immigration, supporting U.S. growth, ensuring a higher degree of affordability, and mitigating additional inflationary pressures.\nThe domestic birth rate is insufficient to address the labor shortages already emerging in the U.S. economy. The U.S. fertility rate has been decreasing since the 2008 financial crisis, dropping almost 23 percent between 2007 and 2022. Birth rates are now below the replacement rate and are unlikely to return to that rate anytime soon (Figure 1).\nFellow, Economics Program and Scholl Chair in International Business\nSenior Adviser and Scholl Chair Emeritus, Economics Program and Scholl Chair in International Business\nAdjunct Fellow (Non-resident), Economics Program and Scholl Chair for International Business\nFormer Intern, Economics Program and Scholl Chair in International Business", "The average U.S. fertility rate was  per woman as of 2022, far below the 2.1 children necessary to sustain a population. Yet the United States is faring better than many other developed countries. Germany\u2019s rate was around  per woman in 2022, and Japan\u2019s was  per woman in 2023. Italy, in turn, is in a tougher spot, with only  per woman as of 2022. South Korea\u2019s birth rate, a very low  per woman, is expected to fall further. Out of the Group of Seven (G7) nations, only France boasts a higher rate than the United States, at around  per woman. However, the French rate\u2014which is falling, like that of every other nation mentioned above\u2014is still not enough to stabilize the population (Figure 2).\nAs a result, the United States, along with many developed countries, is aging (Figure 2). The proportion of the U.S. population over 65 increased at the fastest rate ever between 2010 and 2020. In 2020, one in six people in the United States was 65 or older. The median age in the United States increased from 37.2 years in 2010 to 38.4 years in 2019\u2014a trend that shows no signs of slowing, driven by aging baby boomers.

In fact, the 18-and-below age group was smaller in 2019 than in 2010. Working-age adults, by nature of their role in society, produce more than they consume and serve as a source of financial support to the nonworking population, chiefly through tax contributions to public transfer programs, as well as direct private transfers.", "The rate at which the U.S. population is aging is also outpacing the growth of the working-age population, posing a significant threat to the economic future of the United States. The U.S. dependency ratio, which is the ratio of Americans under 15 or over 65 to the working population, reveals this issue clearly. In 2010, the U.S. dependency ratio sat at 49, meaning that there were 49 dependents for every 100 working-age Americans. By 2019, the ratio grew to 53.7 dependents per 100 working-age Americans, driven by the growth in the 65-and-older population.\nThe shrinking workforce as a proportion of the population will pose significant problems for the U.S. economy if these concerns are not addressed promptly to ensure existing labor shortages do not continue to grow and that future shortages are addressed preemptively. The reality is that the productive segments of the population\u2014namely, the workforce\u2014contribute most significantly to the economy through their labor, consumption, and contribution to public services through taxation. In comparison, the for those over 65 was only 24.5 percent in September 2024 due to the high number of retirees. Moreover, retirees do not contribute income taxes while simultaneously consuming less and being a greater burden on public services.

Per capita effects are less predictable: An injection of additional workers into the labor market could negatively impact some people in the pre-existing workforce, native- and foreign-born, while positively impacting others. The wages and employment prospects of many will be unaffected. The direction, magnitude, and distribution of wage and employment effects are determined by the size and speed of the inflow, the comparative skills of foreign-born versus native-born workers and of new arrivals versus earlier immigrant cohorts, and the way other factors of production such as capital adjust to changes in labor supply. Growth in consumer demand (immigrants also buy goods and services), the industry mix and health of the economy, and the nation\u2019s labor laws and enforcement policies also come into play.", "The primary determinant of how immigration affects wages and employment is the extent to which newly arriving workers substitute for or complement existing workers. As laid out theoretically in , wages may fall in the short run for workers viewed by employers as easily substitutable by immigrants, while wages may rise for individuals whose skills are complemented by new workers. For example, suppose foreign-born construction workers enter the labor market, causing a decrease in construction workers\u2019 wages. Firms will respond by hiring more construction workers.

Further, where the availability of low-skilled immigrants at lower wages allows businesses to expand, total employment will rise. Wage and employment effects are predicted to be most pronounced in skill groups and sectors where new immigrants are most concentrated.\nGiven the potential for multiple, differentiated, and sometimes simultaneous effects, economic theory alone is not capable of producing decisive answers about the net impacts of immigration on labor markets over specific periods or episodes. The role and limitations of theory were assessed by , p. F324):", "Economic theory is well suited to help understand the possible consequences of immigration for receiving economies, and the theoretical aspects of the possible effects of immigration for the receiving economies\u2019 labour markets are well understood. That is not to say that predictions of theory are clear-cut, however. It is compatible with economic models that changes in the size or composition of the labour force resulting from immigration could harm the labour market prospects of some native workers; however, it is likewise compatible with theory that immigration even when changing the skill composition of the workforce has no effects on wages and employment of native workers, at least in the long run. Economic models predict that labour market effects of immigration depend most importantly on the structure of the receiving economy, as well as the skill mix of the immigrants, relative to the resident population.\nEmpirical investigation is therefore needed to estimate the magnitude of responses to immigration by employers, by native-born and earlier-immigrant workers and households, by investors, by the public sector, and in housing and consumer-goods markets (, p. 1). Dynamic conceptual approaches are needed to assess some of the impacts of immigration, particularly those that require long periods of time to unfold.\nIn the context of the U.S. experience, immigrants have historically been most heavily represented in low-skilled occupations. This has prompted an extensive body of empirical work investigating whether immigration has had a negative effect on the wages and employment of low-skilled", "Detailed discussion of when immigrant labor complements and when it substitutes for native employment can be found in Foged and Peri (2014) who analyzed relative employment effects using longitudinal employer-employee data for Denmark covering the period 1991-2008. and also examined this question using evidence from the Census Bureau\u2019s Longitudinal Employer Household Data on worker displacement in high-immigration industries.\n\"5 Employment and Wage Impacts of Immigration: Empirical Evidence.\" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. _The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration_.

The basic challenge to overcome in empirical work is that, while wages before and after immigration can be observed, the counterfactual\u2014 _what the wage change would have been if immigration had not occurred_ \u2014cannot. A range of techniques has been used in the construction of this counterfactual, and all require assumptions to facilitate causal inference (i.e., identifying assumptions).

We first describe and present results from studies, which compare worker outcomes across geographic areas. Next, we review results from analyses that use aggregate (nationwide) data, including studies, which compare worker outcomes across groups defined to have similar education and experience, and studies, which implement the skill cell approach with a closer connection between theory and empirical estimation. Much of the discussion in these sections is concentrated on studies of the overall labor market and the low-skilled labor market. Later in the chapter, we turn our attention to evidence about high-skilled labor markets, including the effect of skilled immigration on innovation and entrepreneurship.\nSpatial studies define subnational labor markets\u2014frequently, these are metropolitan areas\u2014and then compare changes in wage or employment levels for those with high and those with low levels of immigrant penetration, controlling for a range of additional factors that make some destination locations more attractive than others.

Departing from the focus on how the average wages of different native groups respond to immigration, we examine how immigrants shape the overall wage distribution. Despite evidence indicating that an increased presence of low-skilled immigrants is associated with losses at the lower end of wage distribution, we do not observe a similar result between high-skilled immigrants and natives at the upper end. Instead, the presence of foreign-born workers, whether high- or low-skilled, is associated with substantial gains for high-wage natives, particularly those at the very top. Consequently, increased immigration is associated with greater wage dispersion.\nImmigration, Labor market, Wage inequality, Skill\nThe wage consequence of immigration has been vigorously debated in the United States and other receiving countries. Proponents of more strict immigration policies emphasize the potential negative impacts of immigration on native workers: an increased supply of labor would heighten the competition in the labor market and reduce wages (; ). Given that many immigrants are low-skilled (), the influx is likely to drive down the wages of low-skilled workers and result in higher inequality. Others have argued that the adverse effects are overstated. Although low-skilled native workers may face some competition, the actual impact of immigration is tangential (; ; ).", "In this study, we examine the connection between immigration and wage inequality in the United States between 1980 and 2015. Departing from the literature focusing on how the average wages of different native workers respond to immigration, we examine how immigration may promote wider dispersion of native wage distribution. The distinction is important because within-group heterogeneity has grown in recent decades, particularly among high-skilled workers. Not only did the top experience tremendous gain, but the wage variance among college-educated workers also increased substantially (, ).\nAnalytically, we separate immigrants into two skill groups and test how unconditional wage distribution responds to each flow of immigration. We find that an increased presence of low-skilled immigrants is associated with a small wage loss for natives at the bottom. Yet, the competition is more intense among low-skilled immigrants, who earn significantly lower wages as the number of their peers increases. A similar pattern is not present between high-skilled immigrants and natives. Rather, the presence of foreign-born workers, whether high- or low-skilled, is associated with substantial wage gains for natives at the upper end. Consequently, the influx of migrant labor is associated with a greater dispersion of native wages.", "By exploring how the impact of immigration varies across the wage distribution, this study examines inequality related to population dynamics. It is well documented that contemporary wage inequality is driven by the concentration of income at the top (). A focus on low-skilled workers may miss the link between immigration and rising inequality. Furthermore, studies have shown that the flows of goods and capital widen the distribution of income (; ; ; ; ; ). The flow of labor is less examined for this upward trend. We provide evidence suggesting that the current immigration system may not be distribution-neutral and is associated with the wage surges at the upper end.\nThe concern that immigrants could undermine the wages of native workers lends support from the , which predicts that an increased supply of workers must depress the price of labor (). The wage erosion could take place through direct competition as well as the outflow of squeezed native workers into less competitive locations of the economy, which in turn suppresses the wages in other sectors. Given that many recent immigrants are low-skilled, similarly skilled natives are expected to experience the largest wage loss. Because competition is most plausible when immigrants and natives are otherwise substitutable, studies have often partitioned workers into different skill cells and examined how a within-cell increase of migrant labor alters labor market outcomes of natives.", "Some studies have shown clear evidence for the adverse effect. For example, assuming that immigrants are perfect substitutes for natives with the same characteristics, found that between 1980 and 2000, immigrants reduced the average wage of native workers with similar education and work experience by 3 % to 4 %, and by 9 % for the least skilled. Extending this line of inquiry to Canada and Mexico, found a similar inverse relationship between immigration and native wages. A recent study on the impact of Cuban immigrants in Miami also showed that the supply shock significantly reduced the wages of the least-educated natives and that the effect size could be as large as 30 % (). Taking an occupational approach, reported that immigration has an adverse effect on the wage of native workers who share the same occupation, and the effect is again greatest among low-skilled occupations.\nOther studies questioned the degree to which immigrants compete with native workers. argued that immigrants and natives are imperfect substitutes. As such, the influx of low-skilled immigrant labor explains little of the wage gap between high- and low-skilled natives across cities. showed that the wage impact of immigrant labor is limited when relaxing the assumption of perfect substitutability within skill groups and allowing the elasticity of substitution to vary across skill groups (see also ; ). Using Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, found that immigrants do depress native wages in the industry-skill cells, but the immediate consequence is much smaller than previous estimates: a 10 % increase in immigrant labor led to only a 1 % to 3 % decrease in wages. reported that a larger presence of immigrants leads to a decline of wage growth but higher wages at the point of labor market entry, suggesting that young natives are able to avoid the competition from immigrants by pursuing more advantageous careers."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "8dcf27e2-389b-573c-aac0-fcbcd19245e4", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S092753711930079X", "title": "Minimum wages and the labor market effects of immigration", "excerpts": ["#  Minimum wages and the labor market effects of immigration\nAuthor links open overlay panel, \n  * This paper investigates how the prevalence of minimum wage affects the impact of immigration.\n  * Our identification strategy uses the non-linearity created by the coexistence in the United States of state- and federal-level .\n  * We find that immigration has relatively small detrimental effects on the wages and employment outcomes of competing native workers.\n  * However, the impact of immigration on natives\u2019 labor market outcomes is more negative in states where the effective minimum wage is relatively low.\n  * High minimum wages thus exert a protective effect on natives\u2019 wages and employment, making them less sensitive to competition from immigrants.", "This paper exploits the non-linearity in the level of minimum wages across U.S. States created by the coexistence of federal and state regulations to investigate the labor market effects of immigration. We find that the impact of immigration on the wages and employment of native workers within a given state-skill cell is more negative in States with low minimum wages and for workers with low education and experience. That is, the minimum wage tends to protect native workers from competition induced by low-skill immigration. The results are robust to instrumenting immigration and state effective minimum wages, and to implementing a difference-in-differences approach comparing States where effective minimum wages are fully determined by the federal minimum wage to States where this is never the case.", "The effect of immigration on the labor market outcomes of native workers is one of the most controversial issues in modern labor economics (Borjas, 2014). Most early studies (see Card, 1990, Hunt, 1992, and, for a review of that early literature, Friedberg and Hunt, 1995) concluded that the effect of immigration on the labor market outcomes of natives is negligible. However, the results from more recent studies are mixed, some of them finding significant negative effects (see Borjas, 2003, Dustmann, Sch\u00f6nberg, Stuhler, 2016b, and, for a review of the more recent literature, Edo, 2019). By using spatial correlations between wages (or employment) and measures of immigrant penetration, the results from the early investigations could indeed lead to misleading interpretations (Borjas, Freeman, Katz, 1997, Dustmann, Fabbri, Preston, 2005). Obviously, labor is not an exception to the law of supply and demand. If wages do not fall after an immigration-induced increase in labor supply, this could be due to any of the following departures from the standard model. First, immigrants and native workers may not be perfect substitutes, either because they have different education levels or, within a given education category because they have complementary skills and work in different occupations (Dustmann, Frattini, Preston, 2013, Ottaviano, Peri, 2012, Peri, Sparber, 2009). Second, the labor supply shock caused by immigration may not be exogenous, especially if immigrants sort themselves to destinations with high wage and employment prospects (Dustmann, Fabbri, Preston, 2005, Llull, 2018a). Even if the immigration shock is exogenous, it can induce labor supply responses on the natives\u2019 side which will blur identification", ". This will be the case for example if native workers respond to immigration by acquiring additional skills (Hunt, 2016, Llull, 2018b), by emigrating to other local labor markets (Borjas, 2006, Cadena, Kovak, 2016, Monras, 2015, Piyapromdee, 2017) or both (Ortega and Verdugo, 2016), therefore violating the assumption. And third, labor market imperfections such as wage rigidities, unions, or other institutional characteristics may prevent wages or employment to adjust (Angrist, Kugler, 2003, Edo, 2016, Glitz, 2012).", "The main contribution of this paper is to provide yet another estimate of the wage (or employment) response to immigration but to investigate the role of labor market institutions, and more precisely of the minimum wage, in determining such response. We find that immigration has relatively small but statistically significant detrimental effects on the wages and employment outcomes of native workers with comparable skills, and show evidence of important heterogeneous effects across U.S. States. In particular, we show that the impact of immigration on natives\u2019 labor market outcomes is more negative in states where the effective minimum wage is relatively low. In contrast, sufficiently high minimum wages tend to protect native workers from any adverse wage or unemployment effects of immigration. The first result (main effect) is consistent with the rest of the literature implementing the national skill-cell approach (Borjas, 2003, Llull, 2018a). Note that this approach, which we implement at the state (rather than national) level, neglects by construction any potential cross-skill group complementarities, as well as any capital-stock adjustments that could have positive wage impacts for all native workers (Dustmann, Sch\u00f6nberg, Stuhler, 2016a, Lewis, 2011, Ottaviano, Peri, 2012). These channels be taken into account when discussing the impact of immigration on the labor market outcomes of the native worker. The second result (on the differential effects across US States) is consistent with the literature investigating the labor market effects of immigration in the presence of wage rigidities (Br\u00fccker, Hauptmann, Jahn, Upward, 2014, D\u2019Amuri, Ottaviano, Peri, 2010, D\u2019Amuri, Peri, 2014). It complements the view that, by possibly affecting wage-setting mechanisms as well as reservation wages, labor market institutions can mitigate or exacerbate the responsiveness of wages (and/or employment) to immigration"]}]}, {"query": "studies on productivity changes with increased legal immigration in the US", "retrieved_documents": [{"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "bd4360f2-66a2-5fcb-bde6-e170535799d2", "url": "https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2025/jan/recent-surge-immigration-impact-measured-productivity-growth", "title": "The Recent Surge in Immigration and Its Impact on ...", "excerpts": ["# The Recent Surge in Immigration and Its Impact on Measured Productivity Growth\nLabor productivity\u2014real nonfarm business output divided by total hours worked\u2014is a critical measure of economic health, and since 2023, it has been increasing at a brisk pace.

For the CBO estimate, I prorated the CBO projection for full-year 2024, which can be found in \u201c[The Demographic Outlook: 2024 to 2054](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59899#_idTextAnchor007),\u201d January 2024. Despite this undercount, the blog post showed that the impact of this discrepancy on the aggregate unemployment rate is very modest.\nAs my earlier post explained, the CPS definition of a recent immigrant depends on when the survey was conducted. In even survey years (as in 2024), recent immigrants are defined as those who reported immigrating in that year or the previous two calendar years. In odd survey years, recent immigrants are defined as those who reported immigrating in that survey year or the previous calendar years.", "Why is it important to identify recent immigrants? Recent immigrants tend to have higher unemployment rates than U.S. natives and earlier immigrants. Yet they constitute a small share of the labor force (1.9% in the CPS data for October 2024). Assuming the \u201cmissing\u201d recent immigrants per the CBO\u2019s estimates had similar labor market outcomes as those recorded in the CPS, the share of recent immigrants in the labor force would instead be 3.7%, as my earlier blog pointed out. Still, the aggregate unemployment rate would be only a modest 0.10 percentage points higher\u20144.24% instead of 4.14%.\n## Productivity Measurement: Why Undercounting Might Matter\nWhile the undercount of recent immigrants has minimal effects on the unemployment rate, its implications for productivity measurement are potentially more significant. Productivity growth depends critically on the accurate measurement of total hours worked\u2014the denominator in the calculation. If growth in total hours is understated because of missing recent immigrants, productivity growth will appear artificially high. It is important to note that this blog post assumes there is no mismeasurement of the numerator\u2014namely output.", "To get a sense of how an undercount of recent immigrants affects estimates of hours worked, I construct an alternative measure of total hours, assuming (1) a net increase of 8.65 million recent immigrants (as per the CBO) from January 2022 to October 2024 rather than 3.94 million (as per the CPS) and (2) that the \u201cmissing\u201d recent immigrants had the same employment rates and average hours worked as those recorded in the CPS.As of October 2024, the CPS recorded 4.91 million people who had immigrated to the U.S. since January 2022 and were still residing in the country; this represents the total number of recent immigrants living in the country in that specific month. In this exercise, I took the difference between the CPS\u2019 net change in immigrants (both recent and older) and the CBO\u2019s net change in immigrants and then added it to 4.91 million. This provides an approximate upper bound for the number of recent immigrants.\nThe figure below compares the annualized quarterly growth rate in total hours between this alternative measure and the original CPS estimate. For example, total measured hours in the CPS decreased by 0.17% in the second quarter of 2024 but would have increased by 1.18% under this adjusted scenario. In the third quarter of 2024, the corresponding numbers were 0.79% and 1.96%, respectively.", "## Annualized Growth Rate in Total Hours Worked\nSOURCES: IPUMS, Congressional Budget Office and author\u2019s calculations.\nNOTE: In the 2024 survey, \u201crecent immigrants\u201d are defined as those who reported immigrating in that year or the previous two calendar years.\n## BLS and CPS: Comparing Estimates\nBecause labor productivity growth can be approximated as the growth in output minus the growth in hours worked, the inclusion of the missing recent immigrants would reduce labor productivity growth by more than 1 percentage point in the second and third quarters of 2024, if adjusted CPS hours were used to calculate productivity. More broadly, the difference between the adjusted and unadjusted hours in the figure above serves as an indicator of the potential for upward bias in productivity growth caused by the undercounting of recent immigrants.\nHowever, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which calculates labor productivity, uses a different source for hourly data. The BLS primarily uses data from the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey to calculate total hours worked, with the CPS providing supplemental data for unpaid family workers and self-employed proprietors. The two surveys are distinct: The CES is conducted monthly as an establishment survey of about 119,000 businesses and government agencies, while the CPS is conducted monthly as a sample survey of about 60,000 American households. And unlike the CPS, the CES does not collect information on immigration status, making it unclear whether the BLS total hours estimates are affected by similar undercounts.", "To investigate this, the next figure compares total hours worked based on three sources: CPS data, adjusted CPS data (accounting for the missing recent immigrants) and BLS data\u2014all normalized to 100 in the first quarter of 2022. While the evolution of CPS and BLS estimates tended to closely align before 2022, a gap emerged afterward. Notably, adjusting the CPS data for the missing immigrants eliminated this gap from 2023 onward, suggesting that the CES likely records recent immigrants\u2019 contributions accurately."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "857dde1d-a561-501a-b6b8-0ca102ca3452", "url": "https://www.nber.org/digest/mar10/effect-immigration-productivity-evidence-us-states", "title": "The Effect of Immigration on Productivity: Evidence from US ...", "excerpts": ["A monthly periodical featuring non-technical summaries of research on topics of broad public interest.\n#  The Effect of Immigration on Productivity: Evidence from US States\n> _A one percent increase in employment in a US state, attributable only to immigration, is associated with a 0.4-0.5 percent increase in income per worker in that state._\nImmigration during the 1990s and the 2000s significantly increased the presence of foreign-born workers in the United States, but the increase was very unequal across states. In The Effect of Immigration on Productivity: Evidence from US States (NBER Working Paper No. ), NBER Research Associate analyzes state-by-state data to determine the impact of immigration on a variety of labor market outcomes, including employment, average hours worked, and average skill intensity, and on productivity and income per worker.\nPeri reports a number of distinct findings. First, immigrants do not crowd-out employment of (or hours worked by) natives; they add to total employment and reduce the share of highly educated workers, because of their larger share of low-skilled relative to native workers. Second, immigrants increase total factor productivity. These productivity gains may arise because of the more efficient allocation of skills to tasks, as immigrants are allocated to manual-intensive jobs, promoting competition and pushing natives to perform communication-intensive tasks more efficiently. Indeed, a measure of task-specialization of native workers induced by immigrants explains half to two thirds of the positive effect on productivity.", "Third, Peri finds that inflows of immigrants decrease capital intensity and the skill-bias of production technologies. The decrease in capital intensity comes from an increase in total factor productivity; the capital-to-labor ratio remains unchanged because investment rises coincident with the inflow of immigrants. The reduction in the skill-intensity of production occurs as immigrants influence the choice of production techniques toward those that more efficiently use less educated workers and are less capital intensive.\nFinally, Peri finds that for less educated natives, higher immigration has very little effect on wages, while for highly educated natives, the wage effect of higher immigration is positive. In summary, he finds that a one percent increase in employment in a US state, attributable only to immigration, is associated with a 0.4 to 0.5 percent increase in income per worker in that state.\nA central challenge in establishing a causal link between immigration and economic outcomes is the fact that immigrants may be disproportionately attracted to states with strong economic performance. Peri recognizes this problem, and uses information on state characteristics, such as the location of a state relative to the Mexican border, the number of ports of entry, as well as the existence of communities of immigrants there before 1960 to predict immigrant inflows. He then studies how these predicted inflows, rather than actual inflows, are related to labor market outcomes. He argues that the state characteristics that underlie his predictions are not likely to be associated with either labor market outcomes or productivity. He also controls for several other determinants of productivity that may vary with geography such as R and D spending, computer adoption, international competition in the form of exports, and sector composition.\nNBER periodicals and newsletters may be reproduced freely with appropriate attribution.", "In addition to , the NBER disseminates affiliates\u2019 latest findings through a range of free periodicals \u2014 the , the , the , and the \u2014 as well as online , , and .\nN.

During the last decades of the 19 century, immigrants contributed substantially, providing labor for the industrialization and electrification of the country. That wave of immigration was ended by the very restrictive immigration laws passed in 1929. While the \u201cImmigration and Nationality Act\u201d of 1965 abolished national quotas and allowed the flow of immigrants to resume, it has only been during the last 30 years that the mobility of the world\u2019s people has increased significantly. Young, motivated, and often highly educated people are on the move, and many of them would like to come to the United States. With its 41 million immigrants, the United States is by far the largest magnet for international migrants. Moreover, according to Gallup World Polls, there are about 150 million more people who say that they would migrate to the United States (from every country on the planet) if they had the opportunity.", "While immigration flows, if managed efficiently and flexibly, would bring strong opportunities for economic growth, U.S. immigration laws remain outdated, cumbersome, and rather restrictive. These laws have substantially limited immigration for work-related reasons, both among the highly educated (scientists and engineers) and the less educated (construction, agricultural, and personal service workers). The misalignment between restrictive laws and economic incentives has also caused the population of undocumented immigrants to expand rapidly. Attracted by employment, but unable to secure a legal permit, 11 million people work and have set down roots in the United States, despite great uncertainty and little protection.\nOn June 27, 2013, the U.S. Senate seemed set to change all that, by passing Senate Bill 744, the \u201cBorder Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.\u201d The bill is the result of compromise, and is therefore imperfect. Still, it could become the most important piece of legislation on immigration of the last 50 years. It addresses most of the relevant issues plaguing the U.S. immigration system and deals with the problem of undocumented immigrants. As of today, however, due to political polarization, it seems unlikely that the House will pass the bill, despite its potential benefits for the U.S. economy.\n### Who Migrates to the U.S. for Economic Reasons?", "Abundant research, based on comprehensive data on net migration to rich countries, has shown that two groups have a much higher propensity to migrate internationally. The first group consists of the highly educated, in particular, college-educated individuals. They have emigration rates four to five times higher than workers with no college education, and in poor countries, they are 10 to 12 times more likely to migrate. The second group is made up of the young: individuals between 20 and 40 years of age have the highest propensity to migrate. After 45, few people choose to leave their home countries.\nLooking at the United States, a very large group of immigrants (as a percentage of the native population with similar skills) is made up of young, highly educated workers, mainly scientists and engineers. Another large group consists of young workers with little education who are employed in highly manual-intensive occupations. Figure 1 shows that ordering schooling levels from low to high and reporting the percentage of foreign-born workers for each skill group reveals a clear, U-shaped distribution. The percentage of foreign-born workers, as of 2011, was very high among workers with no degree, mainly employed in manual-intensive jobs. It was also very high among highly educated science, technology, engineering, and math workers (STEM). The percentage of foreign-born workers was much smaller for intermediate levels of education. The group of immigrants with very little education included a large part of the undocumented workers. This was due, in part, to the fact that there are very few legal ways for foreign workers with low schooling levels to enter the United States, despite there being significant demand for them. The current composition of U.S. immigrants follows the labor market logic. Adapting immigration laws to reflect this logic, as the proposed reform would do, makes perfect sense and would improve efficiency.\n### The Economic Effects of Immigrants", "The very simple logic of demand and supply implies that, other thing being fixed, an increase in the labor supply reduces wages as workers compete in an increasingly crowded economy. While correct on its face, this is \u201cpartial equilibrium\u201d reasoning. Since partial equilibrium models rely on the assumption that other things are kept fixed, they do not account for the series of adjustments and responses of the economy to immigration. Still, that simple logic is often pushed to its Malthusian implication that more workers in an economy mean lower wages and lower incomes. These partial equilibrium implications are likely to be incorrect, theoretically and empirically, in \u201cgeneral equilibrium.\u201d The workings of four important mechanisms attenuate \u2014 and often reverse \u2014 the partial effects of an increased supply of foreign workers on the demand for native workers.\nFirst, as a consequence of the availability of more workers, firms invest: they expand their productive capacity and build more establishments. The productive capacity (capital) per worker has grown in the U.S. economy at a constant rate during the period from 1960 to 2009. If anything, capital per worker was higher when immigration was at its peak in 2007 than it was in 1990 before the immigration boom began. Investments, that is, were responsive to the predictable inflows of workers. Hence, immigrants did not crowd out existing firms over the long run. Rather, they increased the size and number of firms providing investment opportunities.", "Second, workers are not all the same. In terms of their labor market skills, there is a large difference between workers with tertiary education and those with a secondary education or less. It makes sense to distinguish between these two groups because they do different jobs. A modified version of the wage-depressing effect of immigrants is that, if the relative supply of less-educated workers among the foreign-born is larger, their inflow would depress the wages of less-educated natives relative to highly educated natives. In the U.S., however, because of the combination of immigrants at the top and the bottom of the schooling distribution (as seen in the chart on the next page), immigrants have had a balanced distribution. The overall proportion of college-educated immigrants has been very similar to that of natives. So, their inflow did not significantly alter the relative supply of those two broad groups. Labor economists consider the split between the tertiary and non-tertiary educated as the most relevant factor for understanding the effects of relative supply on relative wages.\nSince immigration did not alter the relative supply of these two groups, it is unlikely to have changed their relative wages. At the national level, immigration cannot explain the observed increase in the relative wage of college-educated workers versus high-school graduates observed in the 1980s and 1990s, simply because it did not much affect that relative supply.\n### Specialization and Technology: Job Upgrades"]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "20c952db-5910-5cc4-8a91-d58833324270", "url": "https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/new-us-curb-high-skill-immigrant-workers-ignores-evidence-its-likely", "title": "New US curb on high-skill immigrant workers ignores ...", "excerpts": ["# New US curb on high-skill immigrant workers ignores evidence of its likely harms\nSeptember 22, 2025 4:30 PM\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday an unprecedented new restriction on lawful immigration to the US by high-skill workers.

But if successful, the change would severely damage the most important channel for US entry by workers with advanced degrees and specialized knowledge, causing profound and widespread harm to Americans\u2019 incomes and job opportunities.\n\u201cThis misguided measure could shut down the H-1B program entirely,\u201d Jennifer Hunt, an economics professor at Rutgers University and one of the on economic impacts of high-skill immigration.\n#### _Watch recommended video (2:50 minutes)_\n## Decades of Research Document Broad Harms from this Unprecedented Tax\nH-1B workers are not merely jobholders; their labor is a crucial factor of production that drives US economic growth and opportunity, extensive research has found. From 1990 to 2010, rising numbers of H-1B holders [caused 30\u201350 percent of ](https://doi.org/10.1086/679061) in the US economy. This means that the jobs and wages of most Americans depend in some measure on these workers.\nThe specialized workers who enter on this visa fuel high-tech, high-growth sectors of the 21st century economy with skills like computer programming, engineering, medicine, basic science, and financial analysis. Growth in those sectors sparks demand for construction, food services, child care, and a constellation of other goods and services. That creates employment opportunities for native workers in all sectors and at all levels of education.", "This is not from a textbook narrative or a computer model. It is what happened in the real world following past, large changes in H-1B visa restrictions. For example, Congress the annual limit on H-1B visas after 1998, then slashed it by 56 percent after 2004. That produced large, sudden shocks to the number of these workers in some US cities relative to others. Economists traced what happened to various economic indicators in the most-affected cities versus the least-affected but otherwise similar cities. The best research exhaustively ruled out other, confounding forces.\nThat\u2019s how we know that workers on H-1B visas cause dynamism and opportunity for natives. They [cause more patenting of new inventions](https://doi.org/10.1086/651934), ideas that create new products and even new industries. They cause entrepreneurs to found more (and more successful) . The resulting productivity growth [causes more higher-paying jobs for native workers](https://doi.org/10.1086/679061), both with and without a college education, across all sectors. American firms able to hire more H-1B workers , generating far more jobs inside and outside the firm than the foreign workers take.\nAn important, rigorous new study found the firms that win a government lottery allowing them to hire H-1B workers [produce 27 percent more than otherwise-identical firms](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/16917) that don\u2019t win, employing more immigrants but no fewer US natives\u2014thus expanding the economy outside their own walls. So, when an influx of H-1B workers raised a US city\u2019s share of foreign tech workers by 1 percentage point during 1990\u20132010, 7 percent to 8 percent higher wages for college-educated workers and 3 percent to 4 percent higher wages for workers without any college education.", "This is what Americans will lose if the new skill penalty stands, slamming the door in the face of the most skilled, specialized workers from around the world. And about a third of these high-skill foreign workers are , staying after graduation to offer their skills to American firms. These are the people whom the new tax is designed to exclude en masse.\n## Concealing Evidence, Not Overlooking It\nWhat about the numerous assertions in the president\u2019s proclamation that H-1B visas harm competing tech workers who are US natives? It mentions a study finding that \u201c _wages for American computer scientists would have been 2.6 percent to 5.1 percent higher \u2026 absent the importation of_ [H-1B] _foreign workers into the computer science field_.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t identify the study. But I know exactly which study it is, and the president\u2019s order grossly misrepresents it\u2014somehow neglecting to mention that the same study proceeds to describe widespread economic harm from the same skill penalty.\nThe study is , with a less technical version . It was being written by the superb economist and his coauthors when I hired Gaurav as a postdoctoral fellow. That research is based on a computer model. It finds that the infinitely complex US economy is fully described by a small number of equations, native computer scientists\u2019 wages decline when more foreign tech workers are available.\nIt is a brilliant computer model, built carefully at high academic standards for simulations of its kind. But no such simulation provides a secure basis for drastic policy change when the numbers it generates are flatly contradicted by a [more direct and transparent approach](https://doi.org/10.1086/679061): simply observing what happened in the real world after past policy shocks. That suggests cautious and measured policymaking, not sledgehammering of entire congressionally mandated visa classes.", "Now set aside that concern for a moment. Take as unquestioned truth the wage effect from the computer simulation that the president cites. In that case it is disturbing to read of .\nThe study finds that H-1B workers caused vast, nationwide benefits to Americans as a whole. H-1B workers did this by increasing the efficiency of information technology services, benefiting almost all American consumers. It finds that back in the late 1990s, the period it considers, Americans in general benefited by $15.2 billion to $20.2 billion per year in today\u2019s dollars. And H-1B workers caused value-added by US firms overall to rise by 0.7 percent, which would mean $25 billion each year. More value-added by US firms means higher market value for those firms, and thus greater wealth for the [two-thirds of Americans who own shares](https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx), especially retired Americans. And these are just the short-run effects, decades ago, studied by that paper (1994\u20132001), omitting much larger, widespread benefits to productivity emerging over the last quarter century.\nIn other words, the study trusted by the president to demonstrate economic harms of H-1B visas actually concludes that the H-1B program will cause enormous net economic harms to Americans in general. It finds that those harms vastly exceed any benefits to competing workers. The president\u2019s order simply omits these findings.\n## The Concealed Evidence Undermines the Legal Basis for the Skill Penalty\nThis concealment is striking by itself. But it takes on added significance given the legal authority that the US president invoked to impose the new visa fee.", "That authority rests on the economic facts that the presidential proclamation suppresses. No US law grants the president the power to impose arbitrary quotas or taxes on the H-1B or any other visa, and certainly not to decimate with a penstroke entire visa classes mandated by Congress. Rather, explicitly derives its authority from a 1952 law whose section \u201c212(f)\u201d to \u201csuspend the entry\u201d of \u201cany aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nIn other words, the US president cannot bar entry to a broad class of immigrants on a whim. He only has the legal authority to take any action like this when there is clear evidence that those immigrants are \u201cdetrimental to the United States.\u201d The president rests his case for that authority on a study _that reaches the opposite conclusion_ : that H-1B workers as a class cause massive and widespread net benefits to Americans as a whole, to US firms specifically, and to anyone who owns shares in US firms.\nBut he ignores this finding, which is extremely prominent in the paper he references. That is not plausibly an oversight.\nAnd what about the effect of H-1B workers on US computer scientists\u2019 wages? The proclamation checks the findings of that computer simulation by quoting another study that seems to offer a smoking gun: \u201cone study of tech workers showed a 36 percent discount for H-1B \u2018entry-level\u2019 positions as compared to full-time, traditional workers.\u201d\nAgain, the proclamation does not tell the public what study that is. I know what study that is, and again, the proclamation grossly misrepresents its findings."]}]}]}

Entrepreneurs and researchers, who are motivated by economic incentives, generate new ideas that result in either new or expanded businesses. The resulting expansion of businesses generates new and better products and services. Entrepreneurs also change the way production is organized because they improve efficiency that lowers prices for consumers. Such actions produce economic growth, which manifests itself by increasing product variety, jobs, and wages. As a result, economic well-being increases (Alcigit and Kerr 2018; Jones 1995, 2016; McCloskey 2016; Romer 1990).\nImmigrant entrepreneurs play a role in the economic growth process. Higher levels of immigration increase economic growth through an immigrant\u2019s productive skills and innovation-related activities (Ortega and Peri 2014). Immigrants also account for a large share of patents in the United States. In addition, immigrants contribute to new businesses and tend to be more entrepreneurial than the average U.S. citizen (Kerr 2019).\nImmigration is controversial because people have differing views about the effects that immigrants have on the economy and culture. This article focuses on the economic rather than cultural effects of immigration. Although it is unlikely that culture and the economy are unrelated, there is evidence that cultural diversity, when measured by the diversity of a country\u2019s immigrants, raises native wages and the rental value of homes (Ottaviano and Peri 2006; and Nowrasteh and Powell 2021).", "Some U.S. citizens are concerned that the increase in immigration may change the country\u2019s national identity. Others view immigrants as being similar to themselves: immigrants are people trying to improve their life and economic circumstances. Political rhetoric intensifies such differences, thereby making immigration reform less likely. A look at polling data provides a sense of the divergent views that individuals have on immigration. Polling data in the United States suggest that people are generally divided over the effects of immigrants on the country.\nA 2020 CBS News poll asked, \u201cGenerally, do you think immigrants coming to the United States make American society better in the long run, make American society worse in the long run, or you don\u2019t think immigrants coming to the U.S. have much of an effect on American society one way or the other?\u201d Among respondents, 55 percent said better, 16 percent said worse, and 20 percent said it did not have much effect (CBS News 2020).\nA 2020 Gallup poll asked the question, \u201cIn your view, should immigration be kept at its present level, increased, or decreased?\u201d Among respondents, 36 percent wanted to keep it at the present level, 34 percent thought it should increase, and 28 percent wanted it decreased. Whereas responses have fluctuated over time, the percentage of people who think the level of immigration should be increased equaled only 7 percent in the earliest poll taken in 1965. Respondents who thought it should be kept at the same level or decreased declined over the same period suggesting, at least until recently, that immigration appeared to be viewed more favorably (Gallup 2020).", "Those polls suggest that people in the United States are divided about the costs and benefits of immigration. U.S. citizens should keep in mind that immigrants, especially high-skilled ones, start new businesses and play an important role in technological innovation\u2014both of which help create jobs and raise wages for everyone. Immigrants help provide important services such as in health care (Lincicome 2020). The net benefits of immigration promote economic growth and well-being, thus expanding opportunities for both immigrants and native-born populations in the United States.\nTo better understand the effects of immigration on the economy, this article will provide basic data about immigration trends in the United States. The main body of the article will review the evidence from studies that examine the effects of immigration on entrepreneurship and innovation.\n## Immigrants in the United States\nImmigrants are people living in the United States who were not U.S. citizens at birth. Immigrants include naturalized U.S. citizens, green-card holders, refugees, asylees, temporary visa holders, and unauthorized persons. Table 1 provides data about the total number of immigrants (measured in thousands). It also expresses the number as a percentage of the U.S. population between 1960 and 2019. Both measures have increased significantly over the period.", "Table 2 provides a breakdown of immigration data by country of origin. For each country, if it was in the top 10 (by amount) for the years between 1960 and 2019, the table lists the percentage of total immigrants from that country in that year. For the years in which the country was not in the top 10, no data are reported. More than 10 countries are listed because, over time, countries in the top 10 in early years drop out and new countries enter the top 10. Two trends are apparent. First, European countries make up a larger portion of source countries in the earlier years but not in later years. Second, the share of total immigrants from Asia, Central America, and South America has increased over time. Unsurprisingly, Mexico captures the largest share by far in 1980 and beyond.\nTable 3 provides the educational attainment level for immigrants from 10 countries with the largest share of immigration in 2019. Panel A looks at all immigrants, while Panel B looks at the same group of countries but for all the immigrants who came to the United States after 2013. The skill distribution of immigrants tends to have a U\u2011shape. Skill levels concentrate at the high and low ends of the distribution. We can see this concentration in Table 3. I calculate that, for all immigrants between 1960 and 2019, 26.3 percent had fewer than 12 years of education, whereas 32.7 percent had a bachelor\u2019s degree or more (Panel A). For comparison, in 2019, 36.3 percent of native-born U.S. citizens had a bachelor\u2019s degree or more, and 6.7 percent had not graduated from high school. Those percentages change for the more recent immigrants: 18.6 percent have fewer than 12 years of education whereas 47.9 percent have a bachelor\u2019s degree or more (Panel B). The skill mix of immigrants as measured by education level has changed, with fewer unskilled workers and more skilled workers.", "More than 85 percent of recent immigrants from India have a bachelor\u2019s degree or more. Other countries that provide a large percentage of skilled labor include China and the Philippines. Moreover, Guatemala, Mexico, Vietnam, and the Dominican Republic provide the largest shares of unskilled labor.\nThe number of immigrants has increased both in absolute numbers and as a share of the U.S. population. Moreover, the countries of origin have shifted from Europe to Latin America and Asia. The share of higher-skilled immigrants has risen, while the share of lower-skilled immigrants has declined.\nData indicate the growth in entrepreneurship in the United States is slowing (Congressional Budget Office 2020). Decker et al. (2014) report that in recent decades the trend has been downward in the growth of business startups. The decline has accelerated since 2000. One way to offset this trend is to expand immigration, especially among higher-skilled entrepreneurial immigrants.\nFairlie et al. (2018, 2019) found that the average number of startups between 1995 and 2010 was 5.4 million per year, which represents about 25 percent of the total businesses in the United States. Such startups create about 3 million jobs in their startup year and employ 2.9 million workers five years later. These figures are comparable with those reported in Decker et al. (2014). The employment growth of the surviving firms more than offsets the job losses of firms that exit. In fact, without the additional jobs, aggregate U.S. employment growth would have been negative during this period.\nKerr and Kerr (2020) report that immigrants tend to be more entrepreneurial than the average U.S. citizen. The difference can be explained partly by the fact that an individual\u2019s decision to emigrate is risky, much like starting a new business. Immigrants, by their nature, appear to be more tolerant of risk."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "3b87e88b-6836-5f03-b2de-57e6a1b007e4", "url": "https://www.csis.org/analysis/immigration-policys-role-bolstering-us-technology-edge", "title": "Immigration Policy's Role in Bolstering the U.S. Technology ...", "excerpts": ["#  Immigration Policy\u2019s Role in Bolstering the U.S. Technology Edge\nCritical Questions by \nIn a December 2022 to MIT, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo addressed one of the greatest strengths of the United States\u2019 technological innovation ecosystem: the ability to attract and retain some of the world\u2019s best STEM talent. The remarks coincided with the 50th anniversary of the opening of relations between the People\u2019s Republic of China and the United States and as both countries enter an era of strategic competition anchored by economic rivalry. As the United States seeks to maintain an economic edge over its main competitor, the Biden administration recognizes that the country should remain at the forefront of global innovation during this era of technological change and competition. One of the cornerstones of promoting U.S. innovation lies in the country\u2019s ability to continue attracting global talent to drive research and development efforts.\nQ1: What is immigration\u2019s effect on the U.S. innovation landscape?", "Many bodies of research affirm that a nation\u2019s openness to migration overall income per capita by increasing the range of skills and ideas in the host country. Beyond general economic opportunities, however, immigrants are particularly effective at bolstering their adoptive country\u2019s enterprise landscape. The United States has indeed benefited from that trend. The Mercatus Center\u2019s Robert Krol, who specializes on immigration and international trade issues, compiled a of evidence about immigration to the United States that illustrates how it increases innovation, firm startups, and general economic dynamism. The main causes of immigrants\u2019 penchant for fostering innovation can be explained by a heightened to making high-risk/high-reward decisions, a growing of degrees in STEM fields, a higher likelihood of collaborating with foreign inventors, and a more in-depth understanding of international markets. A from the National Bureau of Economic Research finds that immigrants \u201cmake up 16 percent of all US inventors, but produced 23 percent of total innovation output, as measured by number of patents, patent citations, and the economic value of these patents.\u201d Their study also shows how these immigrant entrepreneurs have an innovation dividend, making U.S.-born individuals more inventive. All in all, immigrants are responsible for of aggregate innovation, much of which is linked to their interactions and contribution to the work of U.S.-born peers. \nQ2: How does the technology sector benefit from immigration?", "In the technology sector, immigration\u2019s effect on innovation is even more pronounced. The NBER researchers that around 34 percent of engineering and technology companies were founded by immigrants between 1995 and 2005\u2014and 52 percent of Silicon Valley startups. In addition, immigrants have founded or acted as key managers of of Silicon Valley\u2019s startups valued above $1 billion. Immigrants are also essential in academic research of critical technologies. Immigrants make up a large of graduate students in artificial intelligence (AI)-related fields such as computer science and electrical engineering. A from the National Bureau of Economic Research finds that H-1B-driven increases in scientists, technology professionals, engineers, and mathematicians are responsible for between 30 to 50 percent of the aggregate growth in U.S. output between 1990 and 2010. The Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Laura Taylor-Kale recently immigration\u2019s contribution to technological advances in light of the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Infrastructure and Jobs Act.\nQ3: How has the Biden administration framed the role of innovation in its policy goals?", "The Biden administration\u2019s senior officials have emphasized the essential role of innovation in achieving U.S. foreign policy objectives. Secretary Raimondo\u2019s noted that the foundational element of the U.S. strategy to combat systemic Chinese challenges to the global rules-based order is to make transformational investments in U.S. innovation. At the Global Emerging Technologies Summit, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan how the United States is \u201cpursuing a modern industrial and innovation strategy to invest in our sources of strength at home, which also powers our strength around the world.\u201d One of the main pillars of this strategy, according to Sullivan, is nurturing top STEM talent. National Economic Council director Brian Deese reinforced that idea as he laid out for a Modern American Industrial Strategy, in which technological innovation based on encouraging the development of a talented and diverse workforce keeps the United States on the cutting edge.", "In addition, much of the U.S. national security apparatus depends on maintaining the country\u2019s technological edge. A by James Manyika and Admiral William H. McRaven assessed that the Defense Department and the intelligence community will fall behind without access to more technologies and talent. To that end, several specific areas of innovation are the forefront of the national security discussion. Sullivan and Raimondo both pointed to computing-related technologies (such as quantum information systems and AI), biotechnology, and clean energy. Deese stressed the importance of a connected, digital economy through the expansion of high-speed internet access. The White House has released several iterations of a Critical and Emerging Technologies that summarizes a subset of novel technologies that would chart new pathways in innovation and further national security objectives. All in all, it comprises 18 categories, from advanced computing to space technologies and systems, that will shape tomorrow\u2019s innovation landscape. The clear of these remarks and findings is that \u201cadvancements in science and technology are poised to define the geopolitical landscape of the 21st century.\u201d Creating an environment that promotes innovation is therefore an imperative for the United States to achieve its foreign policy objectives.\nQ4: How can the United States improve its immigration policies to bolster its technological advancements?"]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "8b9ecd0c-5a61-56d9-8915-973aa01c7056", "url": "https://www.mercatus.org/research/working-papers/effects-immigration-entrepreneurship-and-innovation", "title": "The Effects of Immigration on Entrepreneurship and ...", "excerpts": ["#  The Effects of Immigration on Entrepreneurship and Innovation \nAlthough immigration is a divisive issue, US policymakers can benefit from a better understanding of how immigrants affect the economy.

Even unauthorized immigrants who lack work authorization pay these taxes: on top of sales and property taxes, many work on the books using a fake Social Security number or one belonging to another worker, and as a result pay payroll taxes.\nOn balance, do these payments exceed the government spending that immigrants receive? At the federal level, immigrants pay more in taxes over time than they use in government services and benefits, according to a [landmark report by the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2016/09/new-report-assesses-the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration) and a range of .

Between 2000 and 2022, the foreign born accounted for nearly three-quarters of all growth in the civilian, prime-age (age 25 to 54) labor force. As the U.S. population ages and more U.S.-born residents enter retirement, immigration will become increasingly important for driving labor force growth. Due to population aging, the number of U.S.-born people of prime working age (age 25-54) hardly changed between 2000 and 2022. In contrast, the number of foreign-born people of prime working age grew by almost 7 million over this period. And the U.S.-born senior population (age 65 and older) grew by almost 18 million over the same timeframe.\nThis trend will only accelerate in the future.

Around the world, government efforts to raise fertility through economic incentives or family-friendly policies have a .\n## Do Immigrants Take Jobs from U.S. Workers?\nWhile immigration skeptics have charged that immigrants take jobs from the U.S. born, in particular Black workers, the evidence demonstrates that immigrants [have taken a larger slice of a growing jobs pie](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/beyond-black-jobs-controversy) over recent decades rather than displacing American workers.\nThe number of U.S. jobs is not fixed: In addition to filling jobs, immigrants also foster job growth by consuming goods and services and by starting businesses.", "Further, when employers hire immigrants, they often do so to fill critical positions that enable them to expand operations and , including U.S.-born workers. For example, if a chip manufacturer is able to hire more highly specialized computer scientists from abroad, they can expand overall operations and hire more U.S.-born workers to fill technician, sales, accounting, and other roles.\nBecause immigrants are more likely to appear both at the higher and lower ends of the educational spectrum than the U.S. born, they often fill jobs that complement those held by U.S.-born workers. Some immigrants have skills that most U.S. workers lack (specialized engineering skills, for example), while others fill jobs that are not attractive to U.S. workers because of the wages or working conditions (for example, in agriculture or roofing).\nThe U.S. workers who face the most direct competition from immigrants are those without high school diplomas, including other immigrants who came earlier. Those workers are most likely to see their wages lowered by immigration. But these wage effects are small, with that immigration results in wage declines of just a few percentage points or no wage effects at all.\nWhile the costs of immigration to local governments and to less-educated U.S. workers should not be discounted, immigrants on balance are net contributors to the U.S. economy when considering their contributions to the labor market, to overall economic growth, and to government coffers.\n  * National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, [The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration, 2017](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration).\n  * Congressional Budget Office, [Effects of the Immigration Surge on the Federal Budget and the Economy](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60569), April 2024.", "* Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, [Unprecedented U.S. Immigration Surge Boosts Job Growth, Output](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2024/0702), July 2024.\n  * magazine, [Immigration Is Powering the U.S. Economy](https://time.com/6963553/immigration-u-s-economy/), April 2024.\n  * Migration Policy Institute, [Beyond the \u201cBlack Jobs\u201d Controversy: Immigrants and U.S.-Born Black Workers Share a Growing Jobs Pie](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/beyond-black-jobs-controversy), August 2024."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "38c87ab4-22bb-597e-9b12-1843b0c7369e", "url": "https://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/north-american-century/benefits-of-immigration-outweigh-costs/", "title": "Benefits of Immigration Outweigh the Costs", "excerpts": ["Contributions immigrants make are an economic boost we cannot overlook.\nImmigration has emerged as a top issue in the presidential campaign.

Interestingly, greater innovation among immigrants appears to boost it among natives, too. Immigrants innovate more than natives because they are concentrated in STEM occupations where there is lots of R&D and entrepreneurial activity\nForty-four percent of medical scientists are foreign born, for example, as are 42 percent of computer software developers. Immigrant workers are also overrepresented among college professors, engineers, mathematicians, nurses, doctors and dentists, to name a few.\nIf immigration makes the economy larger, more efficient and productive, what\u2019s the problem?

In other words, the immigration surplus does not accrue equally to everyone. It goes primarily to the owners of capital, which includes business and land-owners and investors.\nComplementary workers also benefit. The demand for these workers rises with more immigration. They may be construction supervisors, translators, pharmaceutical reps, or immigration lawyers. And consumers benefit from the lower prices of the goods and services that immigrants produce. But competing workers\u2019 wages fall, at least in the initial transition period as the economy adjusts to the new labor inflow.", "Research suggests that previous immigrants suffer more of the adverse wage effects than do natives. Prior immigrants are more like current immigrants.\nResearch also suggests any negative wage effects are concentrated among low-skilled and not high-skilled workers. Perhaps that is because high-skilled U.S.-born workers are complementary to immigrants to a greater extent than native low-skilled workers, who hold jobs that require less education and fewer language skills.\n## Overall, we are talking about a plus\nLast year, the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the George W. Bush Institute partnered to release this book containing an in-depth analysis of the correlation between immigration and economic growth. \nImmigration is thus a positive but also disruptive change. There are lots of historical examples of positive yet disruptive economic change. The Industrial Revolution displaced millions of farm workers and resulted in the great urban migrations and the birth of mega-cities to which we now ascribe all kinds of positive attributes, including creativity and innovation and higher wages. \nNo great change is without some short-term cost. What is costly in the long-term is preventing market forces from funneling resources to their best use. The adjustment of wages and prices to the changing demand and supply in the economy are the levers of capitalism that direct resources to their best allocation.\nImmigration has net benefits. The fact that it has some costs is not a reason to bar it, but rather to manage it. Mechanisms can be found to benefit from immigration\u2019s gains while making up for the losses of some workers.

All told, the number of immigrants rose to 53.3 million in January 2025 (about 15.8 percent of the population), up from under 10 million in 1965 (about 5 percent of the population). High rates of immigration in part reflected legislation in the 1960s that opened pathways to legal immigration to a much wider and diverse set of countries. Since 2000, the population of highly-educated foreign-born workers grew at an especially strong rate, as they were well-placed to obtain permanent residence status and then naturalization (see ). More recently, since 2021, there was a sharp increase in the population of unauthorized immigrants (those without full legal status, which includes people who entered the United States illegally and people who were allowed to enter through the use of parole authority and who may be awaiting proceedings in immigration court.) As COVID-related restrictions on border crossings were eased, many immigrants received temporary paroles or deportation protection as asylum seekers, victims of crime and violence, and refugees from countries facing war and natural disasters. The estimated population of unauthorized immigrants jumped from 10.2 million in 2019 to a record high of [Looking at the 2023 foreign-born population](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/08/21/key-findings-about-us-immigrants/) (the last year for which complete data is available), 46 percent were naturalized U.S. citizens, 27 percent were lawful residents with permanent or temporary residence permits, and 27 percent were without full legal status (of which 40 percent had parole or some other form of protected status).", "* However, recent shifts in government policies have led to a sharp reversal in net immigration flows, as the number of new immigrants has been sharply curtailed and aggressive actions have been taken to repatriate unauthorized immigrants living in the United States. The annual net flow of immigrants peaked at 3.4 million people in 2023, far above the previous peak of over 1.5 million in 2014 (see chart). Starting in mid-2024, however, entries through the various asylum and parole programs were limited by the Biden administration.

The speed at which the economy can grow over a longer horizon is determined by changes in the total amount people are working \u2014 which involves both the number of workers in the labor force and the hours they work \u2014 and the efficiency with which they produce goods and services. Estimates of the negative impact of a reduction of labor force growth on GDP growth depend on the assumptions made on the drop in net migration, but the order of magnitude is similar across studies. A recent AEI  of this impact was based on projections that the net change in the population of immigrants over age 16 will be in the range of -525,000 to 115,000 in 2025, down from 2.2 million in 2024. The analysis suggested that this shift would reduce GDP growth in 2025 by 0.3 - 0.4 percentage points as potential growth in employment is cut from 140,000-180,000 jobs a month in 2024 to 10,000-40,000 jobs a month in the second half of 2025.

In regions with large populations of less educated, low-income immigrants, native-born residents bear significant net costs due to immigrants\u2019 use of public services, especially education.", "# The Effects of Immigration on the United States\u2019 Economy\nToday, the United States is home to the largest immigrant population in the world. Even though immigrants assimilate faster in the United States compared to developed European nations, immigration policy has become a highly contentious issue in America. While much of the debate centers on cultural issues, the economic effects of immigration are clear: Economic analysis finds little support for the view that inflows of foreign labor have reduced jobs or Americans\u2019 wages. Economic theory predictions and the bulk of academic research confirms that wages are unaffected by immigration over the long-term and that the economic effects of immigration are mostly positive for natives and for the overall economy. \nFigure 1 shows that the foreign-born population has grown rapidly in recent decades, rising from less than 5 percent of the U.S. population in 1970 to 13 percent in 2013. Although immigrants today comprise a larger share of the population than at any time since World War II, the foreign-born share today is roughly the same as during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when about 15 percent of U.S. residents were born in a foreign country.\nFigure 1: Foreign-Born Share of U.S. Population, 1850-2013", "Has the surge in immigration since 1970 led to slower wage growth for native-born workers? Academic research does not provide much support for this claim. The evidence suggests that when immigration increases the supply of labor, firms increase investment to offset any reduction in capital per worker, thereby keeping average wages from falling over the long term. Moreover, immigrants are often imperfect substitutes for native-born workers in U.S. labor markets. That means they do not compete for the same jobs and put minimal downward pressure on natives\u2019 wages. This might explain why competition from new immigrants has mostly affected earlier immigrants, who experienced significant reductions in wages from the surge in immigration. In contrast, studies find that immigration has actually raised average wages of native-born workers during the last few decades. \nImmigrants are at the forefront of innovation and ingenuity in the United States, accounting for a disproportionately high share of patent filings, science and technology graduates, and senior positions at top venture capital-funded firms. In addition, the presence of immigrants often creates opportunities for less-skilled native workers to become more specialized in their work, thereby increasing their productivity. \nImmigration generally also improves the government\u2019s fiscal situation, as many immigrants pay more in taxes over a lifetime than they consume in government services. However, native-born residents of states with large concentrations of less-educated immigrants may face larger tax burdens, as these immigrants pay less in taxes and are more likely to send children to public schools.", "A popular view is that immigrants are taking jobs from American citizens. However, although immigrants increase the supply of labor, they also spend their wages on homes, food, TVs and other goods and services and expand domestic economic demand. This increased demand, in turn, generates more jobs to build those homes, make and sell food, and transport TVs.\nMost empirical studies indicate long-term benefits for natives\u2019 employment and wages from immigration, although some studies suggest that these gains come at the cost of short-term losses from lower wages and higher unemployment.\nStandard economic theory implies that while higher labor supply from immigration may initially depress wages, over time firms increase investment to restore the amount of capital per worker, which then restores wages. Steady growth in the capital-labor ratio prevents workers\u2019 average productivity, and therefore their average wages from declining over the long run. Figure 2 shows the pre-1980 trend in the capital-labor ratio extrapolated over the next few decades \u2013 the period when U.S. immigration accelerated. Consistent with the theory, the actual capital-labor ratio did not significantly or permanently deviate from that trend after 1980. \nFigure 2: U.S. Log Capital-Labor Ratio, 1948-2013 \nLog capital services per worker and trend, business sector. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics and author's calculations.", "While growth in the capital stock keeps average wages from falling, immigration may affect the relative wages of different types of workers by changing their relative supplies. As shown in Table 1, immigration over the last few decades has had a bimodal impact across education groups: The largest impact has been on the supply of workers without a high school degree and of workers at the high end of the education spectrum \u2013 those with a college or postgraduate degree. Relative to the native-born, recently-arrived immigrants are less likely to have completed high school. At the same time, at the higher end, recent immigrants are more likely to have completed college and hold advanced degrees than their native counterparts.\nThus, immigration has primarily raised the supplies of the least and the most skilled workers. \nTable 1.

Many countries intensify their efforts to attract and retain foreign students, which increases the risk of brain drain in the sending countries. In poor countries, this transfer can change the skill structure of the labor force, cause labor shortages, and affect fiscal policy, but it can also generate remittances and other benefits from expatriates and returnees. Overall, it can be a boon or a curse for developing countries, depending on the country\u2019s characteristics and policy objectives.\nThe income-maximizing level of a brain drain is usually positive in developing countries, meaning that some emigration of the more skilled is beneficial.\nA brain drain stimulates education, induces remittance flows, reduces international transaction costs, and generates benefits in source countries from both returnees and the diaspora abroad.\nAppropriate policy adjustments, which depend on the characteristics and policy objectives of the source country, can help to maximize the gains or minimize the costs of the brain drain.\nThe effective brain drain exceeds the income-maximizing level in the vast majority of developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, and small countries.\nA brain drain may cause fiscal losses.\nAbove a certain level, brain drain reduces the stock of human capital and induces occupational distortions.", "The impact of the brain drain on a source country\u2019s welfare and development can be beneficial or harmful. The evidence suggests that there are many more losers than winners among developing countries. Whether a country gains or loses depends on country-specific factors, such as the level and composition of migration, the country\u2019s level of development, and such characteristics as population size, language, and geographic location. Policymakers should gauge the costs and benefits of the brain drain in order to design appropriate policy responses.\nThe term \u201cbrain drain\u201d refers to the international transfer of human capital resources, and it applies mainly to the migration of highly educated individuals from developing to developed countries. In lay usage, the term is generally used in a narrower sense and relates more specifically to the migration of engineers, physicians, scientists, and other very high-skilled professionals with university training, often between developed countries.\nAlthough a concern for rich countries, the brain drain has long been viewed as a serious constraint on the development of poor countries. Comparative data reveal that by 2000 there were 20 million high-skilled immigrants (foreign-born workers with higher education) living in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a 70% increase in ten years. Two-thirds of these high-skilled immigrants came from developing and transition countries.\n## Discussion of pros and cons\n### Key trends in high-skilled migration", "According to the United Nations Global Migration Database, the number of international migrants increased from 75 million in 1960 to 214 million in 2010. This about parallels the growth in the world population, so the world migration rate increased only slightly in relative terms, from 2.5% to 3.1% of the world population. The major part of this change is artificial and due to the break-up of the former Soviet Union, when what was once the internal movement of workers became reclassified as international migration after 1990. Overall, the share of international migrants in the world population has been stable for the last 50 years.\nBut the picture changes when the focus is narrowed to migration to developed countries. The proportion of international migrants residing in high-income countries relative to the total in all possible destinations increased from 43% to 60% between 1960 and 2010. As measured by the proportion of the foreign-born in the total population of high-income countries, the average immigration rate to these countries has tripled since 1960 and doubled since 1985. The increase has followed the same trajectory as the ratio of trade to gross domestic product (GDP) (see ).\nMore of these migrants are coming from non-OECD countries. Indeed, a database of global bilateral migration published in 2011 reveals that as of 2000, migration between developing countries still dominated the global migrant stock: at 72.6 million people, migration between developing countries constituted about 45% of all international migration (see ) . Next came migration from developing to developed countries (55 million, 34% of all migrants) and then migration between developed countries (28 million, 17%). But the growth in the number of migrants was driven largely by emigration from developing countries to developed countries, which increased from ten million to 55 million between 1960 and 2000, faster than trade.", "Emigration rates of high-skilled workers exceed those of low-skill workers in virtually all countries (see ) . The skill bias in emigration rates is particularly pronounced in low-income countries (see [What drives the brain drain, and how can we quantify it?](https://wol.iza.org/articles/brain-drain-from-developing-countries/long#izawol.31-div-000029)). The largest brain drain rates are observed in small, poor countries in the tropics, and they rise over the 1990s. The worst-affected countries see more than 80% of their \u201cbrains\u201d emigrating abroad, such as for Haiti, Jamaica, and several small states with fewer than one million workers. About 20 other countries are losing between one-third and one-half of their college graduates. Most are in sub-Saharan Africa (such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Somalia) or Asia (such as Afghanistan and Cambodia). A few are small, high-income countries (such as Hong Kong and Ireland).\n### Expected adverse and beneficial effects of skilled migration\nThe brain drain has long been viewed as detrimental to the growth potential of the home country and the welfare of those left behind. It is usually expected to be even more harmful for the least developed countries because, as explained above, with increasing development, positive selection in emigration and brain drain rates fall."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "85affd85-bc79-58a1-8b4a-bf9e64b6688a", "url": "https://www.developmentaid.org/news-stream/post/100000/brain-drain-in-developing-countries", "title": "Effects of brain drain in developing countries", "excerpts": ["# Effects of brain drain in developing countries\nPoverty and lack of economic growth trigger thousands of educated people from developing countries to look for better living conditions in richer states.

Our latest editorial takes a deeper dive into the reasons behind brain drain.\nMigration is an omnipresent phenomenon in human history. It to the movement of people from one place to another for temporary or permanent settlement and is often driven by social, economic, or personal reasons. Substantial migratory waves of educated individuals from one country within relatively short periods of time can lead to the occurrence of brain drain. The least developed and developing countries typically experience brain drain more often than developed countries as they offer lower standards of living and thus find it more difficult to retain or attract highly skilled professionals.\nThe concept of brain drain describes waves of substantial levels of migration of highly educated individuals from one country to another.

They include political instability, poor , limited access to health care, and a shortage of economic opportunity. These factors drive skilled workers to leave their home countries for better opportunities. \n###  Organizational and Industrial Brain Drain \nOrganizational brain drain occurs when many skilled workers leave a company due to perceived instability or lack of opportunity.

They can vary based on the type of brain drain that occurs. Major reasons people leave their home countries or regions include: \n  * Economic opportunities including new and better jobs, higher standards of living, access to housing and health care\n  * Persecution based on religion, gender, or sexuality", "Most brain drain is geographic but it can also occur as a result of situational factors.

It can often have a chain reaction. \nAreas affected by brain drain end up with a dearth of . Professionals leaving create a gap that is often hard to fill. For example, medical professionals from developing nations often move to developed countries for better opportunities. There may not be enough qualified people to replace them when they leave. This affects the overall quality of health care. \nAnother effect on areas that experience brain drain is the loss of . Governments depend on income taxes to fund social programs and infrastructure. A mass exodus leads to a drop in tax that can stunt economic growth and development. \nAreas that see brain gain are also impacted. They may face overcrowding, particularly in large cities with more opportunities. A lot of people in one area puts a strain on resources and this can lead to higher prices and taxes. \n##  Strategies to Mitigate Brain Drain \nThere isn't an easy fix for brain drain but business and government leaders can do some things to reduce or minimize it: \n  * Increase investments into certain areas of the economy\n  * Pave the way for legal and social reform\n  * Improve the quality of resources such as housing and healthcare", "##  Real-World Examples of Brain Drain \nBrain drain has notably occurred in Puerto Rico and Ukraine. \nWar and conflict are big catalysts for brain drain. This was evident following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \nStudies conducted by the European Parliament indicated a massive displacement of the country's population across the (EU) even before Russia's invasion. One of the main areas examined was the movement of students. The number of students who left Ukraine doubled from 25,000 to 50,000 between 2007 and 2014. That number jumped to about 78,000 by 2019. The majority of these students were enrolled in post-secondary institutions in Poland. \nSome professionals leaving Ukraine have had a tough time finding work in their fields in other countries because of a lack of available work or transferrable skills. Some are choosing to take on lower-paying jobs to find a sense of security and safety. \nRussia has experienced a flight of human capital, too. placed on the country by the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Canada have had a profound impact on Russian citizens. The federal government implemented laws to punish citizens who supported Ukraine. It's been estimated that as many as 200,000 Russians had left the country by 2022. \nBrain drain was a significant consequence of the Puerto Rican debt crisis in 2019. It was particularly evident in the exodus of skilled medical professionals. This hit the island hard. Almost half of Puerto Rico's residents receive or Medicaid but the island receives significantly fewer federal funds to pay for these programs than similarly sized states on the mainland such as Mississippi. \nThis lack of funding combined with the island's dire financial situation has precluded its ability to offer competitive compensation to doctors, nurses, and other medical staff. These professionals were reported to have left the island en masse for more lucrative opportunities on the mainland as a result."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "fc0d29e6-cabd-5fc3-8427-3ac4b4d87a1d", "url": "https://egc.yale.edu/research/brain-drain-or-brain-gain-new-research-identifies-more-nuanced-story-about-skilled-migration", "title": "\u201cBrain drain\u201d or \u201cbrain gain\u201d? New research identifies a more ...", "excerpts": ["Amid longstanding concerns that emigration causes \u201cbrain drain,\u201d research by EGC affiliate Mushfiq Mobarak and coauthors identifies more complex dynamics at play \u2013 and points to emigration\u2019s potential gains for origin countries. \nMany educated and skilled citizens from low-income countries continue to emigrate to high-income countries. As global education levels rise, international competition for talent intensifies, and many destination countries adopt immigration policies that favor high-skill migrants, the outflow of high-skill migrants from low-income countries is likely to continue. This trend has raised concerns that such high emigration rates may result in substantial losses of human capital for countries of origin \u2013 a phenomenon colloquially referred to as \u201cbrain drain.\u201d\nBut in a new article, EGC affiliate Mushfiq Mobarak and coauthors review papers that apply modern causal identification empirical methods to analyze the effects of emigration in greater detail. Notably, they identified causal channels through which emigration can actually lead to human capital and welfare in origin countries \u2013 a process dubbed \u201cbrain gain.\u201d Their findings paint a more nuanced picture of emigration, which the authors hope can motivate more informed policies in origin countries.\n  * Wage benefits from migration and visa policies in destination countries incentivize investment in specialized education, thereby increasing the human capital stock in origin countries.\n  * Migrants send remittances that help finance local education and businesses, while diaspora networks open new channels for trade and investment, boosting local innovation, entrepreneurship, and knowledge exchange.\n  * Whether emigration leads to brain drain or brain gain is shaped by local capacity and policies, particularly the ability of education systems to produce new skilled graduates and the extent to which business and trade conditions support the reintegration of returnees.", "_Framework containing direct and indirect channels of migration (Batista et al. Science)_\nThe typical story of brain drain is that the emigration of high-skilled workers depletes human capital stock in origin countries. However, Mobarak and coauthors highlight growing evidence showing that new migration opportunities \u2013 such as expanded foreign visa programs for healthcare and technology workers \u2013 can actually increase the stock of high-skilled workers. For example, coauthor Caroline Theoharides from Amherst College has shown that the introduction of a new U.S. visa program for nurses led to large increases in investment in nursing training in the Philippines, such that it ultimately led to an in the number of domestic nurses within the Philippines, since many newly licensed nurses were not ultimately able to move abroad. Similarly, another coauthor Gaurav Khanna from UC San Diego has shown that relaxing the strict cap on H-1B visas \u2013 a U.S. work permit that lets companies hire foreign workers for specialized jobs requiring a college degree or higher \u2013 prompted many Indian students and workers to acquire computer engineering skills, spurring the establishment of new specialized colleges to meet this demand. In short, when migration pathways open or expand, individuals invest in the skills aligned with foreign labor demand, which can lead to skilled workers at home.", "Additionally, Mobarak and his coauthors found that even lower-skilled migrants experience significant earnings gains from working abroad. For instance, Bangladeshi migrants who won a Malaysian work lottery tripled their income relative to others who were unlucky and did not win the visa lottery. The remittances almost doubled the income of their households back home. Other research shows that as migrants send remittances home, these funds can be invested in education over time, paving the way for more high-skilled migration in the future and ultimately boosting income and educational attainment in the origin country. \nImportantly, the researchers emphasize that substantial brain gain can only occur if the origin country possesses adequate training infrastructure to develop skilled labor. To achieve this, policymakers must ensure that institutions can expand the supply of specialized training programs, focusing on vocations and skill sets that align with labor market demands both at home and abroad. \n\u201cYou could have the brain drain effect, unless your country figures out how to produce skilled workers\u201d says Mobarak. \u201cWhether we get brain drain or gain on net depends on that.\u201d\nThe researchers also identified several gains from migration related to business, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As migrants establish diaspora networks abroad, they help attract foreign investment and create links to international markets. Likewise, for migrants who return home, the knowledge and skills gained abroad can be put to use domestically, boosting knowledge transfer. For example, Chinese returnees with foreign management experience were found to increase the valuation and productivity of the firms they joined upon return. Similarly, returnee employees at a large Indian company filed more U.S. patents. Returning migrants can also bring home business ideas developed abroad and establish new firms that rely on local workers.", "The effects of migration in origin countries can also extend to less tangible domains. For instance, migrants and diaspora networks can transmit ideas about political and social norms, including those that promote gender equity in their home countries. In the Bangladesh-Malaysia example highlighted above, there were significant improvements in women\u2019s decision-making power within households when their husband won the Malaysian visa lottery. Such changes in gender norms can generate broader benefits, including improved child health and development outcomes, as well as delayed marriage and childbirth. \nThe income boosts experienced by migrants lead to better living standards for their family members (through remittances), and these income shocks can improve local development in the origin country, from increased educational investment to downstream benefits like fertility and family planning. Moreover, these findings offer some reassurance against concerns that emigration of healthcare workers undermines health outcomes in countries; indeed, migration can lead to an overall brain gain in the domestic healthcare sector.\nWhether migration ultimately leads to brain drain or brain gain depends crucially on which types of workers are in demand within destination countries, as well as on the capacity of the origin countries\u2019 training institutes to produce new skilled graduates in those fields. Since this capacity is shaped by government policy, it is something that policymakers can \u2013 and should \u2013 focus on. \nMobarak hopes that this research can help view brain drain as part of a much broader and more complex migration story, one that also includes important indirect effects and potential spillover benefits.", "\u201cThe risk of brain drain exists, but now, this framework allows us to unpack the elements of that risk,\u201d he says. \u201cRather than saying \u2018brain drain is a problem, so we should discourage migration,\u2019 the question for governments is: 'how do we ensure that migration maximizes the chances of a win-win-win scenario for the source country, the destination country, and the migrant\u2019s family?'\nJohannes Haushofer (Cornell), David McKenzie (World Bank), Daniel Han (Boston University), Catia Batista (NOVA Lisbon), and Dean Yang (Michigan) are the other coauthors of this review paper published in .\n_Research Summary by Peter Zhang._"]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "f2990e09-c694-525a-9856-bdd3f7230dd0", "url": "https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1999/06/carringt.htm", "title": "How Extensive Is the Brain Drain?", "excerpts": ["Use the free to view a pdf file of  Receive emails when we post new items of interest to you. or your profile |  |  A quarterly magazine of the IMF  | [June 1999, Volume 36, Number 2](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1999/06/index.htm)  \nHow Extensive Is the Brain Drain? [William J. Carrington and Enrica Detragiache](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1999/06/carringt.htm#author)\n_How extensive is the \"brain drain,\" and which countries and regions are most strongly affected by it? This article estimates the extent of migration, by level of education, from developing countries to the United States and other OECD countries._\nPerhaps the oldest question in economics is why some countries are rich while others are poor. Economic theory has emphasized that differences in the educational levels of the population are an important part of the answer and that improved schooling opportunities should raise incomes in developing countries. Yet, while there is little doubt that highly educated workers in many developing countries are scarce, it is also true that many scientists, engineers, physicians, and other professionals from developing countries work in Canada, the United States, and Western Europe. This phenomenon, often referred to as the \"brain drain,\" was noticed as early as the 1960s and has been a contentious issue in the North-South debate ever since. One important implication of the brain drain is that investment in education in a developing country may not lead to faster economic growth if a large number of its highly educated people leave the country. Also, efforts to reduce specific skill shortages through improved educational opportunities may be largely futile unless measures are taken to offset existing incentives for highly educated people to emigrate.", "But how extensive is the brain drain? Which countries and regions are especially affected? Do highly educated professionals from developing countries living abroad represent a sizable proportion of the pool of skilled workers in their countries of origin or too small a number to worry about? Unfortunately, attempts to answer these important questions quickly come up against a formidable barrier: there is no uniform system of statistics on the number and characteristics of international migrants. Also, source countries typically do not keep track of emigrants' characteristics, and, although some receiving countries do, their definitions of immigration differ. Thus, it is difficult to measure precisely the flow and levels of education of immigrants. Further, it has only recently become possible to measure the stock of educated workers in each source country\u2014the pool from which brainpower is drained.", "Despite the lack of systematic data about international migrants, estimates of the stock of migrants by educational level in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) can be constructed using a variety of data sources. The resulting estimates are less than perfect in many respects, but they significantly improve our knowledge of the magnitude of the brain drain. The study on which we based this article (Carrington and Detragiache, 1998) covers migration from 61 developing countries accounting for about 70 percent of the total population of developing countries. Because of the lack of data, we have not attempted to estimate the extent of either the brain drain from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, even though casual evidence suggests that it is substantial, or migratory flows among developing countries. We followed a two-step procedure: first, estimates of the brain drain to the United States were constructed using 1990 U.S. census data and other sources of information. Then, these estimates were used\u2014together with data on migrants to OECD countries other than the United States drawn from the OECD's Continuous Reporting System on Migration\u2014to estimate the extent of the brain drain to all OECD countries. While the resulting estimates should be reasonably precise for migration to the United States (which accounts for 54.3 percent of the total migration from the developing countries in our sample to all OECD countries), they are much more tentative for the brain drain to all OECD countries.", "The U.S. census reports whether individuals polled are foreign born and, if they are, what their country of origin is; the number of years of schooling received is also reported for each individual. After individuals under 25 years of age are eliminated to ensure compatibility with the data on educational attainment described below, all foreign-born individuals in the census are put into one of three broad educational categories: primary (0 to 8 years of schooling), secondary (9 to 12 years of schooling), and tertiary (more than 12 years of schooling). A further adjustment involves subtracting from the group of foreign-born individuals with a tertiary education all graduate students in U.S. universities, using data from the Institute of International Education. This procedure yields, for each developing country in the sample, the number of migrants in the United States in each of the three educational categories. To assess the extent of the brain drain from each country considered, these estimates must be compared with the number of individuals in each educational group who remain in their home country. Doing this requires a breakdown by educational category of the population of each developing country in the sample, for which we rely on a data set recently assembled by Robert Barro and Jong-Wha Lee (Barro and Lee, 1993), which provides the best estimates available to date of educational attainment for individuals more than 25 years of age in a large sample of countries.", "## Brain drain to the United States\nThe first striking feature of the U.S. migration data is that immigration flows of individuals with no more than a primary education are quite small, both in absolute terms and relative to other educational groupings (about 500,000 individuals out of a total of 7 million immigrants). Foreign-born individuals with little or no education, however, may be undercounted by the census if they are in the country illegally or do not speak English. The largest group of immigrants into the United States (about 3.7 million) consists of individuals with secondary education from other North American countries (understood here to include Central American and Caribbean countries), primarily Mexico. Perhaps surprisingly, the second largest group (almost 1.5 million individuals) consists of highly educated migrants from Asia and the Pacific. Total immigration from South America and, especially, Africa is quite small. It is noteworthy, however, that immigrants from Africa consist primarily of highly educated individuals (about 95,000 of the 128,000 African migrants). \nAmong the countries in Asia and the Pacific, the biggest source is the Philippines, with 730,000 migrants. Of these, the great majority have a tertiary education. The second largest stock of migrants is from China (400,000), which is split almost equally between the secondary and tertiary educational groups. Both India and Korea have seen more than 300,000 people migrate to the United States. It is striking that more than 75 percent of Indian immigrants have a tertiary education, compared with only 53 percent of Korean immigrants."]}]}, {"query": "ethical considerations in international talent migration", "retrieved_documents": [{"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "8b9b5832-5d45-5642-9c33-f8a2a57dcd2c", "url": "https://icmc.net/future-of-work/report/01-ethical-chart", "title": "International Migration and Work: Charting an Ethical ...", "excerpts": ["# International Migration and Work: Charting an Ethical Approach to the Future\nCenter for Migration Studies, USA Donald J.

Shrinking native populations coupled with rising levels of immigration have, however, led to fear of racial and cultural displacement in many states, rising nationalism, and the vilification of immigrants. As a result, this dynamic may not lead to mutually advantageous policies. and list the nations respectively whose populations will diminish (many developed states) and those that will grow significantly (mostly African states) by 2050.

Through advances in new industries and technologies, U.S. innovation fuels economic growth and creates new jobs that benefit the American workforce. This global leadership in innovation has been attributable in part to America\u2019s unparalleled ability to attract rich and diverse talent from all over the world.\nImmigrant stories of success and innovation are woven intrinsically into the fabric of American history. For example, Sergey Brin escaped the Soviet Union, co-founded Google, and changed the way the world processed information; Katalin Karik\u00f3, an immigrant from Hungary, co-developed the mRNA vaccine technology that helped the United States and the world respond to the COVID-19 pandemic; and Levi Strauss, a Bavarian immigrant, created the quintessentially American blue jeans.

The administration\u2019s actions are having negative impacts across the country, including reducing Americans\u2019 ability to access physicians by preventing foreign doctors from coming to the United States; threatening the educational and social benefits and billions in economic contributions that international students bring to the United States each year; and pushing the world\u2019s brightest to seek a future in other countries to study, research, and work.", "These anti-immigration policies exacerbate the Trump administration\u2019s broader attacks on American innovation. While the administration makes boastful claims about making America\u2019s economy more powerful, its actions are actually hurting U.S. innovation. The administration is making devastating cuts to federal funding for scientific research and development (R&D) and attempting to freeze funding for colleges and universities, rather than prioritizing solutions that spur innovation and prepare American workers for new types of work. In addition, the administration has falsely framed its immigration policies as seeking to serve the interests of American workers.

The report explains the harmful consequences of the administration\u2019s anti-immigration actions on America\u2019s global strength in innovation by describing how the United States is ceding its power to attract global talent to other countries, chilling America\u2019s long-standing role as a beacon for current and future innovators, and harming America\u2019s AI leadership. Instead of restrictive, punitive policies that damage America\u2019s reputation and harm the U.S. economy, the country needs the executive branch to work with Congress to pursue smart policies that benefit American workers and create a better, modern legal immigration system for the United States that fosters innovation, incubates new ideas, supports cutting-edge research, and boosts America\u2019s competitive advantage.", "## The Trump administration\u2019s actions attacking legal immigration threaten American innovation\nImmigrants have made advances for U.S. innovation despite the country\u2019s archaic immigration system, which was last updated 35 years ago. However, instead of working with Congress to fix the system\u2019s flaws, the Trump administration has taken extreme steps to restrict legal immigration to the United States, threatening the future of American innovation. These actions are making it harder and less attractive for foreign nationals to come to the United States to study and contribute their work, skills, and ideas to critical industries.\n#### Targeting international students and researchers and restricting new arrivals\nThe Trump administration is targeting international students and researchers at universities across the country by going after their ability to lawfully study and work in the United States. For example, the U.S. Department of State has revoked more than 6,000 student visas. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has also attempted to terminate more than 4,700 Student Exchange and Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records of international students across the country in an effort to end their ability to lawfully study at American universities.

This report examines the immigration policies of four U.S. economic competitor nations\u2014the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Australia\u2014to offer best practices for ensuring future AI competitiveness.\nThe United States has historically led the world in technological innovation through its internationally renowned education institutions, innovative industries, top-tier research laboratories and, critically, its unique ability to attract talent worldwide. \nImmigrants play a key role in sharpening America\u2019s technological edge. In recent years, the demand for artificial intelligence talent has greatly exceeded domestic supply, leading to a large share of foreign-born AI students, workers and entrepreneurs in the United States. Although important, efforts to increase the domestic AI workforce are insufficient to fill the immediate demand for AI talent. At the same time, other countries are developing their own capabilities and institutions in AI and aggressively recruiting AI talent through new immigration policies. In this competitive environment, current U.S. immigration policies, many of which date back decades, may work against the country\u2019s historic strength in attracting and retaining international talent.", "Although various factors shape any country\u2019s AI competitiveness, this paper will focus solely on immigration policies relevant to AI talent in the United States and four sample economic competitor nations: the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Australia. These countries were selected for their unique policies on attracting international talent in AI and other tech fields. The United States may be able to evaluate lessons learned from these countries to inform domestic policy. On the other hand, if the United States fails to adapt to an increasingly competitive global technology talent landscape, other countries may begin to draw AI talent away from American schools and employers. \n> To ensure America remains competitive for AI talent in the coming years, U.S. policymakers should consider reforms to current immigration statutes, regulations, and agency guidance.Tina Huang and Zachary Arnold\nThis paper analyzes policies relevant to four categories of immigrants: students in AI-related fields of study, workers in AI-related industries, distinguished AI workers (that is, individuals internationally renowned for their achievements in AI), and AI entrepreneurs. These groups represent the range of backgrounds and experience levels that nations need to compete in AI. We explore trends that, taken together, may be making the U.S. immigration system less attractive to these groups relative to other countries\u2019 systems: \n  * Within the last five years, the UK, Canada, France, and Australia have adopted major immigration reforms to attract talent in AI and other technical fields. The United States has not.", "* Despite growing job opportunities, recent graduates and others may be restrained from contributing to the U.S. AI workforce to their full potential\u2014partly due to current caps, backlogs, and sponsorship processes at the expense of the employer for temporary work visas and permanent residency. In contrast, Canada\u2019s new immigration policies quickly bring in skilled migrants and integrate graduates into the workforce. The UK is proposing similar changes to ease and expedite the immigration process for technically skilled migrants.\n  * The United States\u2019 per-country quotas on permanent residency\u2014which remain unchanged for decades\u2014have created a significant bottleneck, especially for Indian nationals who make up the 25 percent of Silicon Valley\u2019s technical workforce. The other countries in this analysis forego quotas on permanent residency status and allow immigrants who meet permanent residency requirements to apply. \n  * Although data is scarce and important trends are in nascent stages, empirical indicators suggest that some new AI-focused immigration policies in other countries are successful.\n  * The United States has long attracted immigrant entrepreneurs with its innovative culture, but does not offer an entrepreneur visa. Entrepreneur visas offered by other countries in this analysis have largely failed due to unrealistic and vague metrics for business success or long processing times. The United States could learn from the mistakes of competitor countries and design its own visa to increase its immigrant entrepreneur population and create jobs for Americans.", "The United States historically and presently benefits from a strong baseline of technological innovation through existing institutions. Immigration trends alone are unlikely to eliminate the U.S. advantage in the near term. However, the global landscape is shifting, and restrictive immigration policies threaten to undermine U.S. AI progress in the long term. To ensure America remains competitive for AI talent in the coming years, U.S. policymakers should consider reforms to current immigration statutes, regulations, and agency guidance. Other countries\u2019 immigration reforms suggest three main lessons: \n  * Improve temporary visa options for skilled workers. The structure of the H-1B temporary work visa prevents AI talent from contributing to the United States to their full potential. In particular, workers seeking permanent residency while on H-1B status\u2014a process that could take years or decades\u2014would need another sponsorship if they wished to switch positions or employers. Further, the H-1B lottery occurs only once a year, forcing employers to wait until the annual draw on April 1 to learn whether critical employees have been selected. In contrast, Canada has no cap on the number of work permits that can be provided year-round and issues these permits in as little as two weeks.", "* Expand opportunities for permanent residency. Allocating permanent residency status based on decades-old caps and immigrants\u2019 countries of origin, rather than the skills they bring to the United States, has created a bottleneck for highly skilled AI workers who wish to contribute to the U.S. AI workforce in the long term. Specifically, the employment-based green card wait time for Indian nationals, who make up 25 percent of Silicon Valley\u2019s technical work force, is 89 years. There are no formal caps or quotas on permanent residency in the UK, France, Australia, and Canada. Instead, immigrants are eligible to apply once they have lived or worked in the country for a set number of years. \n  * While each of the other four countries in this analysis offers some form of an entrepreneur visa, initial results suggest they have been relatively unsuccessful. The United States should strengthen AI innovation by adopting an entrepreneur visa informed by the flaws of competitor nations to better attract and retain AI entrepreneurs."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "7aec61a6-a90f-5af5-82a0-f963b673a1fc", "url": "https://www.gtlaw-insidebusinessimmigration.com/featured/u-s-immigration-strategies-to-attract-retain-and-develop-talent/", "title": "U.S. Immigration Strategies to Attract, Retain, and Develop ...", "excerpts": ["Amid the evolving global economy throughout the past year, employers may be reassessing their approach to talent acquisition and retention. Companies are navigating uncertainty by recalibrating mobility programs, aiming to not only attract but also retain talent to fulfill a skills gap in the U.S. workforce. Central to leveraging foreign talent is the power of immigration branding and messaging. A strategic emphasis on employee longevity proactively curtails workforce attrition and preempts potential labor shortages in the future.\nUnderstanding and leveraging avenues offered by U.S. immigration laws can be pivotal in securing the right skills and meeting business demands to drive success. Employers commonly leverage F-1 student OPT/STEM OPT training and the H-1B and L-1 work visa programs to source foreign workers in the talent ecosystem.\nForeign students with work authorization pursuant to OPT/STEM OPT are prime candidates for expanding a company\u2019s talent pool with long-term development potential. Employers may attract foreign students through internships while the student completes their academic program, post-graduation employment pursuant to OPT/STEM OPT, and subsequent work visa and green card sponsorship. For most foreign students, switching from a student visa to a work permit is often challenging due to the restrictions and limited availability of H-1B visas. However, companies with an overseas presence may be able to set up strategically located hubs abroad to recruit and employ foreign nationals who were not able to obtain an H-1B visa, and then transfer them back to the United States with L-1 intracompany transfer visas following their employment abroad over at least one year. A company\u2019s corporate immigration policy outlining support of various immigration pathways, and benchmarked against the policy of industry peers, is a competitive tool to meet foreign workers\u2019 needs and attract high-potential talent.", "In response to the need for talent retention, employers are strategically tapping into their existing talent pool to bolster operational efficiency. With post-COVID-19 employees seeking greater fulfillment, employers may want to consider proactively refining their retention efforts to include top-tier foreign talent.\nCompanies are increasingly turning to their internal talent reservoirs to bridge skill gaps and curtail additional hiring costs. Retaining current talent is becoming pivotal for success, mobility, and business continuity. To address the evolving landscape of talent retention and the demand from foreign talent for immigration support, employers may consider several key strategies.", "Various immigration pathways offer avenues for continued employment, providing stability to existing talent. For example, some companies leverage sponsorship for work visa programs and employment-based green cards to retain skilled foreign workers. Payment of legal fees and the provision of immigration counsel are initial steps in this effort, and other offerings including immigration seminars for employees and family members, an internal immigration portal with FAQs and self-service features that provide status reports, and access to documents and opportunities for interaction with the immigration team are also important. Employers leverage streamlined extension processes for work authorization to ensure continuity for employees and the business without disruptions. Embracing technological advancements in immigration processes may streamline procedures, reduce processing times, and minimize errors. Further, a robust green card sponsorship program signals a long-term commitment to retain valuable talent and grants employees a sense of security and stability in their professional journey within the company. Clearly defined benchmarks when the company initiates green card sponsorship are not only a recruitment and retention tool but also ensure that foreign workers do not lose immigration status or work authorization.", "Adaptability and foresight also benefit companies navigating corporate immigration policy frameworks. Companies can implement consistent yet flexible approaches to immigration sponsorship that cater to both business needs and the foreign worker\u2019s circumstances. For example, timing adjustments in initiating green card sponsorship may prevent work authorization gaps. Evaluating risks versus benefits might lead to early green card sponsorship for students to safeguard their status and work authorization if they are not selected in the H-1B lottery. Exploring alternative sponsorship options, such as supporting family-based or self-sponsored petitions, could be viable alternatives for a company to retain critical talent and may streamline the process and save time. Finally, recognizing and addressing the needs of dependents, such as spouses and children, within the immigration sponsorship process may be determinative to retain valuable talent.\nCompanies recognize the importance of not just attracting and retaining foreign talent but also developing their skills and potential. With strategic planning, immigration strategies can help advance the capabilities of international talent within a corporate setting.\nDemand for H-1B visas has increased while the number of available visas has remained static. In response, employers are assisting international talent to develop their credentials to become eligible for an O-1 visa as an alternative. The O-1 visa for individuals with extraordinary abilities allows companies to support foreign workers in advancing their careers by recognizing their exceptional talent and contributions. Although the standard to qualify is high, for many foreign workers there are specific steps they can take to proactively bolster their resume toward becoming \u201cO-1 visa ready.\u201d", "Sponsorship of certain visa categories, such as EB-1A for individuals with extraordinary ability or a National Interest Waiver to bypass the requirement to test the labor market, may encourage innovation and leadership among an employer\u2019s foreign workers. Elevating a green card process to a higher preference category generally accelerates the process and the prospect of a higher preference category may lead foreign nationals to excel in their fields, drive innovation, and propel critical progress for the company.\nMultinational employers are increasingly implementing international rotational programs and cross-border exchanges to foster skill development and broaden experiences. This approach not only addresses internal labor shortages but also mitigates the need for expensive talent searches and replacements. These programs offer benefits akin to longer-term assignments, facilitating knowledge transfer and nurturing company culture at a reduced cost. Such exposure can empower foreign workers with diverse market insights, enriching their skill sets and fostering a global perspective. Moreover, it allows businesses to harness internal expertise to bolster critical initiatives. However, the rise in popularity of these short-term rotation and remote work programs may invite heightened compliance measures, including increased audits and inspections. Hence, employers should anticipate a trend towards more rigorous immigration requirements aligning with labor, tax, and social security laws."]}]}]}

Sifting through the full economic and fiscal impacts of immigration is a complex task, but a and consensus by most economists finds that immigration, on balance, is a net positive for the U.S. economy. Still, the public debate over economic impacts continues, as some observers highlight immigrants\u2019 tax payments and labor force contributions, while others underscore education, health care, and other costs to governments.\n## Overall Economic Growth and Impacts\nImmigrants boost overall economic growth by expanding the labor force and increasing consumer spending.The foreign born also start new businesses at higher rates than U.S.-born individuals. Immigrants were involved in the development of in strategic industries in recent years, and [more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/new-american-fortune-500-2024) were founded by immigrants.\nHigher-than-expected immigration [is driving job growth and productivity](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2024/0702) and is projected to continue doing so in the coming years: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the greater level of immigration expected between 2024 and 2034 will [boost gross domestic product (GDP) by $8.9 trillion](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-07/60165-Immigration.pdf).\n## Fiscal Impacts: Do Immigrants Contribute More to Governments than They Cost?", "While immigrants\u2014like U.S.-born individuals\u2014cost governments money for services such as public education, health care, basic infrastructure such as sewer systems and roads, and sometimes public benefits, they also pay into government budgets through sales taxes; property taxes (either directly as homeowners or indirectly through rent payments); and through payroll deductions, taxes on income as well as for Medicare and Social Security. Even unauthorized immigrants who lack work authorization pay these taxes: on top of sales and property taxes, many work on the books using a fake Social Security number or one belonging to another worker, and as a result pay payroll taxes.\nOn balance, do these payments exceed the government spending that immigrants receive? At the federal level, immigrants pay more in taxes over time than they use in government services and benefits, according to a [landmark report by the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2016/09/new-report-assesses-the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration) and a range of . The picture is different at the state and local level. Immigrants tend to cost local governments more than they pay in, primarily due to the cost of their children\u2019s public schooling.", "Immigration has been the major driving force behind U.S. labor force growth over the past 20 years, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Between 2000 and 2022, the foreign born accounted for nearly three-quarters of all growth in the civilian, prime-age (age 25 to 54) labor force. As the U.S. population ages and more U.S.-born residents enter retirement, immigration will become increasingly important for driving labor force growth. Due to population aging, the number of U.S.-born people of prime working age (age 25-54) hardly changed between 2000 and 2022. In contrast, the number of foreign-born people of prime working age grew by almost 7 million over this period.

For example, if a chip manufacturer is able to hire more highly specialized computer scientists from abroad, they can expand overall operations and hire more U.S.-born workers to fill technician, sales, accounting, and other roles.\nBecause immigrants are more likely to appear both at the higher and lower ends of the educational spectrum than the U.S. born, they often fill jobs that complement those held by U.S.-born workers. Some immigrants have skills that most U.S. workers lack (specialized engineering skills, for example), while others fill jobs that are not attractive to U.S. workers because of the wages or working conditions (for example, in agriculture or roofing).\nThe U.S. workers who face the most direct competition from immigrants are those without high school diplomas, including other immigrants who came earlier. Those workers are most likely to see their wages lowered by immigration. But these wage effects are small, with that immigration results in wage declines of just a few percentage points or no wage effects at all.\nWhile the costs of immigration to local governments and to less-educated U.S. workers should not be discounted, immigrants on balance are net contributors to the U.S. economy when considering their contributions to the labor market, to overall economic growth, and to government coffers.\n  * National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, [The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration, 2017](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration).\n  * Congressional Budget Office, [Effects of the Immigration Surge on the Federal Budget and the Economy](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60569), April 2024.", "* Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, [Unprecedented U.S. Immigration Surge Boosts Job Growth, Output](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2024/0702), July 2024.\n  * magazine, [Immigration Is Powering the U.S. Economy](https://time.com/6963553/immigration-u-s-economy/), April 2024.\n  * Migration Policy Institute, [Beyond the \u201cBlack Jobs\u201d Controversy: Immigrants and U.S.-Born Black Workers Share a Growing Jobs Pie](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/beyond-black-jobs-controversy), August 2024."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "2d012d90-2445-5908-9bf1-2fd197af5264", "url": "https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/how-does-immigration-affect-us-economy", "title": "How Does Immigration Affect the U.S. Economy?", "excerpts": ["How Does Immigration Affect the U.S. Economy?

It is crystal clear that immigration expands U.S. gross domestic product and is good for growth. And immigration overall has led to better, not worse, wages and work opportunities for U.S.-born workers. Yet, it is also clear that when workers are denied full and equal labor and employment rights, as some immigrants are when their immigration status is used against them\u2014it makes immigrant workers\u2019 lives more precarious and can harm the people with whom they work side-by-side in the same industries.\nEven in the face of our unjust policy regime, immigration today provides numerous benefits to the U.S. economy. The nation could benefit even more, and the benefit could be shared more widely with a smarter set of immigration policies that benefit all workers.\nThe benefits are too often overlooked, and the challenges it poses for policymakers and U.S.-born workers are often grossly exaggerated. In this paper, we assess the evidence on immigration\u2019s effect on a number of economic outcomes given the policy status quo. We then go on to highlight how immigration status impacts wages and working conditions, and finally, offer recommendations on how to craft a better immigration policy regime\u2014one that grants immigrants their full rights as workers in U.S. labor markets, generating broad benefits for U.S. and foreign-born workers alike. Our key findings are:", "* Immigration is enabling economic growth despite the sharp deceleration in the growth of the U.S.-born workforce. Immigrants have risen as a share of the U.S. population in recent decades. Because immigrants are younger and more likely to be working age than the U.S.-born population, they have risen even faster as a share of the labor force. These trends are driven as much by the sharp deceleration of growth of the U.S.-born workforce as they are by a sharp increase in the absolute scale of immigration flows. Even when available data are adjusted to better reflect the notable increase in immigration in recent years, the growth of the foreign-born population since 2022 is not out of line with other historical periods (and is lower than what prevailed in the late 1990s). What unprecedented in recent years is the rapid deceleration of growth in the U.S.-born population\u2014a population that will soon start seeing outright contraction. Without immigration, the prime-age workforce (between the ages of 25 and 54) would have seen essentially no growth at all in the past quarter century, dramatically constricting the ability to grow our economy and staff key industries.", "* Immigration does not reduce the number of jobs available for U.S.-born workers and has provided a source of deflationary pressure in recent years. Macroeconomic policymakers like the Federal Reserve and Congress have both the necessary tools and the obligation to ensure that demand in the economy is strong enough to absorb willing workers in a reasonable amount of time. Historical periods when job opportunities become scarce were not driven by increased immigration flows but instead by the failures of macroeconomic policymakers to respond in a timely fashion to weakness in demand for labor. Immigration flows generally do not make policymakers\u2019 task of matching macroeconomic supply and demand any harder because immigrants add to both economywide supply (by increasing labor supply) and demand (by buying goods and services). Overall, immigrants likely tilt this balance more toward supply relative to U.S.-born workers, but only by a bit. This net supply increase is sometimes quite useful\u2014by boosting supply a bit more than demand over the 2021\u20132023 period, immigration provided a source of deflationary pressure that helped bring inflation down in those years, while also assisting in preventing a recession.", "* Immigration\u2019s effects on U.S. wages overall range from neutral to slightly positive. Immigrant workers tend to complement rather than substitute for U.S.-born workers of similar educational levels. The educational mix of immigrants is much more similar to that of U.S.-born workers than is often recognized, hence limiting the scope for competition from immigrants to lower wages for any U.S.-born workers of any particular educational background. Additionally, while the overall wage effects from immigration are neutral to slightly positive for U.S.-born workers, it is true that our flawed immigration policy regime often sees employers use the precariousness of some immigrant workers to suppress wage growth in particular sectors. Immigration reforms that remove this precariousness would aid the wage growth of both immigrants and the U.S.-born workers they work alongside in these labor markets."]}]}, {"query": "effects of immigration on Social Security and Medicare", "retrieved_documents": [{"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "50fb1e35-9969-5117-843d-72f7a8d3247e", "url": "https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v74n1/v74n1p27.html", "title": "PERSPECTIVES: Immigrants and Retirement Resources", "excerpts": ["An official website of the United States government\nA website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.\nSecure .gov websites use HTTPS A or means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

Those gaps in wages imply that immigrants may enter retirement at a significant financial disadvantage relative to natives. However, much less work has examined differences in retirement resources and retirement security between immigrants and natives. This topic is important because immigration has often been suggested as a way to improve, at least temporarily, the finances of a Social Security program (see, for example, Lee and Miller (2000), Storesletten (2000), and Board of Trustees (2010)). This approach to improving the financial stability of Social Security can be particularly effective in a system with many illegal immigrants who may pay Social Security taxes but never claim benefits (Goss and others 2013). Understanding how immigrants as a whole fare when they reach retirement is an important consideration when evaluating the costs and benefits of any changes in immigration policy. Although Social Security program rules are neutral in that they do not insure one group differentially from another, it is important to understand the extent to which outcomes might differ for a large immigrant population.", "In this article, we use the Health and Retirement Study () to compare retirement resources of immigrants with those of the native born. Most research on the wealth of immigrants nearing retirement ages does not examine the potential role of Social Security. This is an important omission because Social Security benefits are the most important source of income for most retired Americans. We use data linked with restricted-access data on earnings histories from Social Security administrative records to estimate future Social Security benefits for respondents who have not yet reached retirement age. Then, we supplement those estimated benefits with self-reported data on actual Social Security benefits for respondents aged 65 or older, as well as data on pension coverage, housing, and total net worth. We document differences in retirement resources between immigrants and natives and then explore the role of economic and demographic characteristics in explaining those differentials. Finally, we look at differences in retirement resources of immigrants based on the number of years they have spent in the United States.", "We find that working-age immigrants have lower predicted Social Security benefits than natives and that immigrants over the age of 65 have lower self-reported actual Social Security benefits. These differentials are statistically significant and remain so even after controlling for a number of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics such as education, self-reported health, census division, and race and ethnicity.

Although immigrants in the who have been in the United States for the median number of years (about 36) or less have substantially lower expected resources from Social Security than natives, that gap decreases with additional years of residency.

Our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that at the sample median years of residence in the United States, after controlling for individual characteristics, immigrants in our sample have amassed private wealth to offset about 50 percent of their lower predicted Social Security benefits.

Even if they themselves will not become eligible to receive benefits in their lifetimes, immigrants improve the solvency of a program that provides almost all workers with a foundation of income for their retirement.\nSince Social Security is a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d program, Social Security benefits paid out today are funded from payroll taxes collected from today\u2019s workers, so more workers paying into the system benefits the program\u2019s finances.

Those tax payments are disaggregated by major category in Figure 1.\nGiven that the undocumented population included 10.9 million people in 2022, this $96.7 billion tax payment is equivalent to $8,889 per person. In other words, this analysis finds that for every 1 million undocumented immigrants who reside in the country, public services receive $8.9 billion in additional tax revenue. It bears noting that this figure includes only the taxes borne by undocumented immigrants and that other research attempting to quantify the significance of immigrants to the economy more broadly points toward a higher revenue impact per person.\nIn total, the tax contribution of undocumented immigrants amounted to 26.1 percent of their incomes in 2022. This figure is close to the 26.4 percent rate facing the median income group of the overall U.S. population. This closeness is the net result of factors that tend to lower the tax contributions of undocumented immigrants relative to U.S. citizens (such as lower incomes, lower income tax compliance, and lower smoking rates), as well as factors that tend to increase the contributions of those immigrants (such as tax credit restrictions, reduced likelihood of claiming refunds owed, and lower prevalence of tax-preferred retirement and investment income). These issues are discussed in more detail in the report methodology.", "Most of the tax dollars paid by undocumented immigrants are collected through levies applied to their incomes. This includes broad income taxes as well as narrower payroll taxes levied on workers\u2019 earnings that are dedicated to specific programs. It is well established that undocumented workers contribute to the solvency of major social insurance programs through their tax contributions. They pay taxes that fund Social Security, Medicare, and Unemployment Insurance, among other programs, despite their exclusion from most of those benefits. Figure 2 details the tax contributions that undocumented immigrants make under major social insurance programs.\n### Social Insurance Taxes Attributed to Undocumented Immigrants\nSum of Social Insurance Taxes  \nGrand Total of All Taxes  \nSocial Insurance Share of Grand Total  \nNote: Figures include both the employer and employee share of these taxes.

Main Scenario Description and Example  Part III. Fiscal Impact Estimates  Appendix A: Acronyms and Definitions  Appendix B: Other Fiscal Scenarios \nThis report estimates the lifetime fiscal impact of immigrants, of various ages and educational attainment, to the United States. It offers a methodological upgrade over similar analyses and estimates and evaluates the fiscal impact of various proposed immigration reforms.\nA clear picture of the fiscal cost of immigrants is particularly important, given the ongoing border crisis. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the border surge will number 8.7 million unlawful immigrants between 2021 and 2026. The original analysis in this report finds that the border crisis will cost an estimated $1.15 trillion over the lifetime of the new unlawful immigrants\u2014a cost larger than the entire U.S. defense budget and almost equal to the cost of Social Security in 2023.", "Looking at immigrants more broadly, this report shows that the average new immigrant (lawful or unlawful) has a positive fiscal impact and reduces the federal budget deficit by over $10,000 during his lifetime. For comparison, the average native-born citizen is expected to cost over $250,000 to the federal government. Despite the average immigrant reducing the budget deficit, immigrants without a college education and all those who immigrate to the U.S. after age 55 are universally a net fiscal burden by up to $400,000. The large positive fiscal impact of young and college-educated immigrants pulls up the overall average. Each immigrant under the age of 35 with a graduate degree reduces the budget deficit by over $1 million in net present value during his lifetime.\nTherefore, for policymakers considering the fiscal impact of immigrants to the U.S., the characteristics of people seeking entry into the country are crucial. Certain immigrants are fiscally beneficial; others are fiscally detrimental.\nThis report quantifies the fiscal impact of common immigration reform proposals:\n  * Mass deportations would significantly reduce the national debt over the long run, but a policy of selective legalization, coupled with mass deportations, would be even more fiscally beneficial, reducing the debt by about $1.9 trillion.\n  * Given the education, age, and earnings of H-1B visa recipients, doubling the number of H-1B visas for just one year would reduce the budget deficit by $70 billion over the long run\u2014and by another $70 billion each year thereafter.\n  * The most beneficial immigration policy change would be to exempt STEM graduate degree holders from green-card caps, increasing immigration by some 15,000 people per year and reducing the visa backlog; this would reduce the deficit by $150 billion in the first year and $25 billion each year thereafter.", "* Eliminating refugee resettlement and permanent immigration by parents of U.S. citizens would reduce the debt by a combined $40 billion in net present value every year.\n  * Congress could upskill the existing immigration flow by eliminating the diversity visa category and increasing the visas available to the top employment-based categories, and requiring immigrants to have earned a high school diploma to be eligible for a family visa, reducing the national debt by over $60 billion per year.", "By enacting a selectionist immigration policy\u2014which requires securing the border from unlawful immigration, reducing low-skilled immigration, and expanding high-skilled immigration\u2014the U.S. could reduce future federal debt by trillions of dollars over the long run. This report proposes a legislative package that provides over $2 trillion in net present value during the first year and over $200 billion each subsequent year, without accounting for the additional productivity growth resulting from high-skilled immigration. Furthermore, under these reforms, the annual number of immigrants who are new permanent residents decreases by about 15% after a temporary legalization program and a partial clearing of the employment-based visa backlog. Over the long term, annual legal immigration decreases under this plan from approximately 1 million in FY 2019 to approximately 860,000.\nThere are radical disagreements about the of immigrants in the U.S.\u2014i.e., whether they represent a net burden or net contribution to the coffers of the federal government. Some argue that immigrants will rescue Social Security from insolvency by joining the workforce and paying taxes.[] Others argue that immigrants, particularly those who entered the country illegally, burden taxpayers by receiving welfare and paying little in taxes.[] In June 2024, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released budget projections that assume that immigration stemming from the ongoing border crisis will bolster tax revenues much more than spending, at least in the short term.[]\nThe primary purpose of this report is to resolve this debate by providing policymakers, legislators, scholars, and the public with a detailed analysis of the fiscal impacts associated with immigrants, differentiated by age at arrival and educational attainment. This analysis aims to reveal the lifetime effect on the federal budget of admitting immigrants with specific characteristics.", "At first glance, whether immigrants reduce or expand the federal budget deficit is not obvious. Most analyses offer only a snapshot of the fiscal contributions of immigrants, rather than examine immigrants\u2019 lifetime fiscal impact on the United States. While it is true that most immigrants are of working-age now, immigrants are not necessarily net contributors to the federal budget over their whole lives. The fact that immigrants are generally workers merely reflects the current demographic composition of more workers relative to retirees and children. Past analyses also do not address the potential long-term impacts of altering immigration policies to favor immigrants with particular characteristics.\nThe crucial question that policymakers and researchers should try to answer is: What is the net fiscal impact of immigrants over their lifetime? A selective immigration policy should aim to welcome immigrants who will pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits, in order to reduce the U.S. deficit and thus the debt that future generations will carry. An indiscriminate approach to immigration could spell economic disaster by admitting large numbers of immigrants who pose a net fiscal burden or by rejecting the most productive immigrants who are net fiscal contributors."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "9bd8ccc4-5d83-545d-8d75-3f66c7f3db8f", "url": "https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/23550/chapter/12", "title": "Chapter: 7 Estimating the Fiscal Impacts of Immigration", "excerpts": ["##  7 Estimating the Fiscal Impacts of Immigration - Conceptual Issues \nVisit to get more information about this book, to buy it in print, or to download it as a free PDF. \n\"7 Estimating the Fiscal Impacts of Immigration - Conceptual Issues.\" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. _The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration_. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23550. \nIn formulating immigration policy, information about the impact of immigration on public finances is crucial. Along with the impact on wages and employment (see and ), the per capita impact on taxes and program expenditures is the other factor determining the extent to which immigrants are or will be net economic contributors to the nation. (, p. 225) identifies two other reasons why estimates of current and long-run fiscal impacts are important to policy: First (as discussed in below), immigration may create taxpayer inequities across states and local areas; specifically, regions that receive disproportionate shares of immigrants may incur higher short-run fiscal burdens if the new arrivals initially contribute less in revenues than they receive in public services. Second, projections of the consumption of public services and payment of taxes over time are essential in order to predict \u201cthe full consequences of admitting additional immigrants into the United States.\u201d This chapter discusses the conceptual issues that arise when estimating the fiscal impacts of immigration, recognizing that it is a complex calculation dependent to a significant degree on what the questions of interest are, how they are framed, and what assumptions are built into the accounting exercise. In so doing, the discussion here provides a foundation for the empirical analyses conducted by the panel and reported on in and .\nUnderstanding of the fiscal consequences of immigration has often been clouded because much of the research is conducted by policy-focused", "\"7 Estimating the Fiscal Impacts of Immigration - Conceptual Issues.\" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. _The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration_. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23550. \n, p. 1), \u201cMost of these organizations have a set agenda in favour or against increased immigration. Unsurprisingly, those organizations with a favourable view of immigration tend to find that immigrants make a positive contribution to public finances, while those campaigning for reduced immigration tend to find the contrary.\u201d The partisan nature of the policy debate notwithstanding, careful estimates based on defensible methodologies are possible. , a pioneering effort in this respect, included a detailed discussion of methodological considerations that is still highly relevant (). That volume, along with more recent studies, such as , , , , , and , significantly advanced the conceptual framework for thinking about fiscal impacts, making the task much easier now than it was at the time that was written.", "The first-order of immigration is the difference between the various tax contributions immigrants make to public finances and the government expenditures on public benefits and services they receive. However, a comprehensive accounting of fiscal impacts is more complicated. Beyond the taxes they pay and the programs they use themselves, the flow of foreign-born also affects the fiscal equation for many natives as well, at least indirectly through labor and capital markets. Because new additions to the workforce may increase or decrease the wages or employment probabilities of the resident population, the impact on income tax revenues from immigrant contributions may be only part of the picture. Revenues generated from natives who have benefited from economic growth and job creation attributable to immigrant innovators or entrepreneurs would also have to be included in a comprehensive evaluation, as would indirect impacts on property, sales, and other taxes and on per capita costs of the provision of public goods.\nAdditionally, the full fiscal impact attributable to a given immigrant or immigration episode is only realized over many years. As shown in , albeit with cross-sectional data, the distribution of individuals along the life cycle displays systematically different tax contribution and program expenditure combinations. For example, the child of an immigrant\u2014as with the child of a native-born person\u2014is likely to absorb resources early in life (most notably due to the costs of public education) and therefore is likely\nReferencing this literature affords the opportunity to shorten the methodological discussion here; however, when reporting the panel\u2019s own fiscal estimates, in and , we document in detail the expenditure and revenue categories used in the estimation, along with the underlying methods, assumptions, and modeling choices.", "\"7 Estimating the Fiscal Impacts of Immigration - Conceptual Issues.\" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. _The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration_.

However, later in the life cycle, working and tax-paying adults typically become net contributors to public finances. A full accounting of the fiscal effects of immigration therefore requires information about \u201cthe additional or lower taxes paid by native-born households as a consequence of the difference between tax revenues paid and government benefits received by immigrant households over both the short and the long term\u201d (, p. 2). Reliable estimates of taxpayer impacts over time are important elements of a thorough economic analysis of the costs and benefits of immigration ().\nThe impact of immigrants on government finances is sensitive to their characteristics, their role in labor and other markets, and the rules regulating accessibility and use of government-financed programs. It is often important to distinguish country of origin and legal status of immigrants, as\n\"7 Estimating the Fiscal Impacts of Immigration - Conceptual Issues.\" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. _The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration_.

Impacts vary over time as laws and economic conditions change (e.g., pre- and post-financial crisis) and by place of destination (e.g., by country, region, and state\u2014each of which has its own policies and population skill and age compositions). It is also important to note that, during periods when fiscal balances for immigrants become increasingly negative, such as during major recessions, they likewise become increasingly negative for natives."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "a5e3a5e8-9a38-5048-84e8-84ee4f1f076c", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1094202524000279", "title": "Immigration, legal status and fiscal impact", "excerpts": ["#  Immigration, legal status and fiscal impact\nAuthor links open overlay panel, \nWe develop a model with search frictions in the , wage bargaining and a welfare state, to study the impact of immigrants on the fiscal balance and welfare of natives in the host country. We distinguish immigrants by legal status and account for both their direct fiscal effects, through their  contributions and transfer receipts, and their indirect fiscal and welfare effects, through their labor-market impact. We calibrate the model to the U.S. economy and find that legal immigrants reduce the burden on natives and increase natives' welfare, mainly because their tax contributions greatly exceed the transfers they receive. On the other hand, illegal immigrants' positive welfare impact stems mainly from their positive effect on , which increases income to natives and in turn consumption. A legalization program leads to a fiscal gain, increases natives' welfare and is more beneficial to natives than a purely restrictive immigration policy that reduces the illegal immigrant population.", "Over the last few decades, many developed countries have witnessed rising immigrant inflows. In the United States, for instance, the number of foreign-born residents has increased from around 19 to over 43 million between 1990 and 2015. During the same period, the number of illegal immigrants has grown even more rapidly, from 3 to over 11 million. The rapid inflow of immigrants has spurred heated debate over its economic consequences, such as its potential impact on native workers' wages and employment, and a vast academic literature has emerged, to study mainly the labor-market impacts of immigrants. But the fiscal impact of immigration is also central to this debate. Opponents of immigration often argue that even if the labor-market impact of immigrants is positive or small, we should not overlook the fiscal burden they impose on natives. But do immigrants impose a fiscal burden on natives? And if yes, is it large enough to outweigh any positive labor-market effects on natives' welfare? Although these are important concerns in the debate on immigration, the academic literature on this topic is limited.", "In this paper we evaluate the impact of immigration to the U.S. on natives' welfare within a model that accounts for both labor-market and fiscal effects. We contribute to the literature on the fiscal impact of immigration in two ways. First, we develop a rich framework in which immigrants affect the fiscal balance directly, by receiving government transfers and paying taxes, but also indirectly through their impact on the labor market and income in the host country. The standard approach in the literature has been to consider these two channels separately, by either focusing on estimating the net fiscal contribution of immigrants, based on observed taxes and transfers or by considering only their indirect fiscal impacts through the labor-market. In our framework, even if immigrants receive transfers in excess of the taxes they pay, they might still reduce the tax burden on natives, by increasing income in the host country. But the opposite is also possible; a strong positive contribution of immigrants to the fiscal balance may outweigh any negative labor-market effects on the fiscal balance and natives' welfare. Second, we distinguish immigrants by legal status and allow them to pay taxes and affect the labor market differently. Accounting for immigrants' legal status allows us to compare the effects of purely restrictive immigration policies that aim to decrease the immigrant, and especially the illegal immigrant population, to a legalization program that grants legal status to illegal residents.", "Distinguishing illegal from legal immigrants is important, as they differ in several aspects, thus affect the labor market differently and also contribute to the fiscal balance in different ways. Illegal immigrants are less likely to own capital and firms and more likely to avoid paying some taxes, but face also significantly more restrictions in using public services and welfare benefits than legal immigrants. Moreover, due to their illegal status, they may be restricted to perform certain productive tasks, which are different from those of legal workers, making them better complements in production to native workers than legal immigrants. Given these differences, not distinguishing immigrants by legal status when estimating their fiscal effects may be on oversight, especially for our focus country, the U.S., where a significant fraction of immigrants are unauthorized. \nIt may be also an oversight to consider that illegal immigrants' restrictions in accessing benefits and ability to avoid taxation, are unrelated to their labor-market effects. If they can avoid paying some taxes, they can settle for a lower wage, while firms can avoid payroll costs by employing them. Having also limited access to welfare benefits, such as unemployment benefits, they might have a worse outside option than legal immigrants, which may also force them to accept lower wages. These might be the reasons why firms can save on labor costs by employing them, increase their profits, and in turn, job creation, employment and income, which then increase also the government's tax revenues. Previous studies on the fiscal effects of immigration overlook such effects either because they do not consider labor-market equilibrium responses or because they do not account for legal status.", "Our economy consists of native, legal and illegal immigrant households, firms and the government. Native and legal immigrant households pay taxes on income from wages, dividends, capital and bonds, and also pay consumption taxes. Illegal immigrant households pay only consumption taxes and use their after-tax income for only consumption, because unlike legal immigrants, they do not invest or own firms. On the production side, firms rent capital, hire native, legal and illegal immigrant workers to produce output and pay payroll taxes. There are search and matching frictions in the labor market and wages are determined by bargaining. The government raises revenue by issuing bonds and collecting taxes, provides public goods, pays unemployment benefits to legal immigrants and natives and transfers to all three types of households. We allow for transfers to be allocated differently across natives and immigrants, reflecting the different restrictions they might face in accessing benefits. Because the government must keep the debt sustainable, any fiscal deficit that immigrants generate must be financed through an additional tax, imposed on legal residents. This additional tax constitutes our measure of the fiscal burden that immigrants might impose on natives in our baseline model. We calibrate the model to the U.S. economy and compute the labor market effects and net fiscal and welfare gains or losses with respect to legal as well as illegal immigration and also examine the effects of a legalization program."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "bcc9640b-4ba3-5809-941c-a63203194e21", "url": "https://www.cato.org/blog/fiscal-impact-immigration-united-states", "title": "The Fiscal Impact of Immigration in the United States", "excerpts": ["#  The Fiscal Impact of Immigration in the United States \nGovernment spending in the United States is enormous. Federal and state governments spent over $9 trillion in 2022 on the welfare state, defense, health care, education, and other areas. Taxes and borrowing fund that spending, the latter being a delayed tax increase or spending reduction. Such a large government raises a vital question regarding immigration: Do immigrants consume more in government services than they pay in taxes? In other words, do immigrants impose a burden on taxpayers? In our recent paper, \u201c[The Fiscal Impact of Immigration in the United States](https://www.cato.org/white-paper/fiscal-impact-immigration-united-states),\u201d we investigate this question and find that immigrants pay more in taxes than they consume in benefits, on average.\nMany researchers have grappled with this question. Many years ago, I spent an entire summer reading every on the topic I could find. Later, the National Academy of Science (NAS) published a in 2017 that included a robust fiscal model. Unfortunately, because of the time it takes to produce such a report and delayed government data releases, most of the NAS analyzed years up to 2013 and then projected forward.\nAlthough the NAS report analyzed data from almost a decade ago, it is still widely cited because the issue is so important. Therefore, my colleagues and I decided to update it. We acquired the NAS model from the scholars who produced it and replicated their results. We then produced two different models included in the \u2013 an Updated Model and a Cato Model. Both models analyze the historical, current, and projected impact of immigration on the public fisc. We then present the projected fiscal impacts in net present value terms (NPV).", "The Updated Model updated the NAS results for the year 2018. The only significant methodological change we made is that we could only consider government spending and taxes over the next 30 years, while the NAS report considered the next 75 years. We had to make this change because the NAS model relies on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections for future government spending and tax revenue, and they only publish 30-year projections now. The results of the Updated Model are similar to those of the NAS. The Cato Model makes other methodological changes based on more recent research by other scholars and our own judgments. This post will explain the Cato Model, the methods we used to construct it, and the results.\nThe Cato Model begins on page 132 of the . We make several methodological changes from the NAS based on new findings and our own judgment to better measure and model the fiscal impact of immigration (Box 6 contains our changes). Although we made several changes, three are very important to notice. The first is classifying the young U.S.-born children of immigrants as native-born Americans in the second generation rather than in the first generation (immigrants). This choice is controversial as some argue that U.S.-born dependent children should be counted in the immigrant generation because they wouldn\u2019t be here without the immigrants. That\u2019s a fair point until you realize the same argument applies to every generation. It\u2019s more accurate and easier to classify immigrants as immigrants and native-born Americans as natives, so we did that.", "The second significant change we made is how we predict the final education levels of young individuals. Few individuals have completed their educations by age 15, for instance. The ultimate level of education is important to estimating the fiscal impact because more educated people, on average, earn higher wages, pay more in taxes, and consume fewer benefits. The NAS assigned immigrants their parent\u2019s education level until age 25, after which it predicted their ultimate level of education through regressions based on their country of origin and other factors. The Cato Model took it one step further and assigned ultimate education levels to immigrants under 25 with that predictive regression.\nThe third major change we made was to incorporate an important insight based on by economist Michael Clemens. He argued that the NAS report undercounted the taxes paid because of immigrants working in the United States by overlooking basic microeconomics:\n> Intuitively, after a firm has set its demand for labor and capital to maximize profits, suppose it raises its labor demand by one to hire an immigrant. Without general\u2010\u200bequilibrium shifts in prices or productivity, this increase in labor demand would by definition reduce profits if it occurred without also hiring capital\u2014such as buying an additional computer or renting additional retail space for the worker to use. That additional capital must generate additional capital income, in an amount bounded from below by the reservation price of capital, for a profit-maximizing firm. This yields bounds on the consequent capital tax revenue caused by the worker\u2019s employment. The alternative, implicit assumption maintained by direct fiscal accounting methods is that firms pay wages to the marginal employed immigrant to reduce profits\u2014sacrificing capital income they could have received with a different investment, and thus avoiding the consequent capital taxes.", "The Cato Model thus captures some of the total tax effects of immigration that other models have difficulty apportioning. This methodological change is just the first step in accounting for the total fiscal costs and benefits of immigration that we will expand in future iterations of the Cato Model.\nIt\u2019s best to start with the current results of the Cato Model for the year 2018 compared to earlier years analyzed using the same methods. Table 25 reports subpopulation size for each generation, per capita receipts and outlays, and net fiscal impacts for each generation at different levels of government in 1994, 2013, and 2018. If the ratio of receipts to outlays is greater than 1, that subpopulation pays more taxes than it receives in benefits.\nThe receipts-to-outlay ratio for the first generation is greater than 1 for every level of government and in total, meaning that the first generation pays more taxes than it consumes in benefits. To put their impact in perspective, in 2018, the average per capita fiscal contribution of first-generation immigrants was $16,207. In contrast, the average drain was $11,361, resulting in a net positive fiscal impact of $4,846 per immigrant in 2012 dollars. Multiplied by the number of immigrants present in 2018 (45.4 million), this amount results in a cumulative net fiscal impact of +$220 billion. Adjusted for inflation, that number is 1.2 percent of U.S. GDP in 2018 ($18.7 trillion in 2012 dollars) and 3.7 percent of all 2018 government spending ($6.031 trillion in 2012 dollars). The former number is roughly in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s 2006\u20132018 , which are 1 percent for the United States and between plus or minus 1 percent for most OECD countries", "The fiscal impact in 2018 and earlier years is a good starting point. However, the temporal nature of tax receipts and outlays can change the picture dramatically. For example, the young and the elderly consume more government benefits in the form of education and welfare when young and entitlements and health care when older. They also pay less in taxes when younger and older. The Cato Model finds that immigrant individuals who arrive at age 25 and who are high school dropouts have a net fiscal impact of +$216,000 in net present value terms over the next 30 years, which does not include their descendants. Including the fiscal impact of those immigrants\u2019 descendants reduces those immigrants\u2019 net fiscal impact to +$57,000. By comparison, native-born American high school dropouts of the same age have a net fiscal impact of \u2212$32,000 that drops to \u2212$177,000 when their descendants are included (Table 31).\nOn the opposite side of the educational spectrum, the positive fiscal impact of immigrants with more than a bachelor\u2019s degree is $1.254 million in NPV terms and $1.114 when including their descendants. To show how much the age of arrival matters for the net-fiscal impact, a high-school dropout immigrant who arrived at age 50 imposed a \u2212$37,000 cost, but his descendants only cost \u2212$1,000 due to the limits of the 30-year projection and because not many people have children at age 50 or later. An immigrant with more than a bachelor\u2019s degree has a positive impact of +$589,000 \u2013 less than half if he\u2019d arrived at age 25. An immigrant\u2019s age of arrival and level of education matter the most for predicting their net-fiscal impact."]}]}, {"query": "U.S. immigration policy and its impact on schools and housing", "retrieved_documents": [{"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "a3aebae9-699b-51bb-8186-79c514e3f6f8", "url": "https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/immigration-enforcement-harms-students-schools/", "title": "How Immigration Enforcement Harms Students and Schools", "excerpts": ["# Learning in the Shadows: How Immigration Enforcement Harms Students and Schools\nMicaela McConnell and Steven Hubbard \n_The American Immigration Council is a non-profit, non-partisan organization.[Sign up to receive our latest analysis as soon as it's published.](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/subscribe/)_\nAs students across the United States are returning to the classroom this fall, the lasting and deeply damaging effects of the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation agenda loom over schools.

If these state efforts were to succeed, hundreds of thousands of children (there were about 1 million undocumented children aged 5-18 ) could be barred from education, creating devastating cycles of poverty, social exclusion, and growing inequality.\n## Community Resistance and Local Advocacy\nIn the face of these threats, many states, local school districts, community organizations, and grassroots leaders continue to show up for their students and their families. Across the country, states like have passed legislation that preserves access to education, regardless of immigration status. School districts like have introduced policies to protect immigrant families. Teachers can also undergo on how to support undocumented students and respond if enforcement actions occur.\nThe dedication of local leadership and grassroots mobilization sends a clear message: schools should be safe spaces for learning, not sites of fear and exclusion.\n## The Role of AI in Surveillance and Deportation", "Adding another layer of complexity is the increasing use of artificial intelligence in immigration enforcement. Under contracts with tech companies, ICE has gained access to that aggregate data from sources such as IRS records, Social Security files, passports, and license-plate readers. These systems often operate without transparency or oversight and can disproportionately impact immigrant communities.\nThere are growing concerns that AI-driven surveillance could be used to track migrants, refugees and asylum seekers who engage with public services, including . AI is already being used to track and revoke the visas of international students across the United States.Though the full impact of the technology is still being assessed, its usage and reach are expanding rapidly. Without safeguards, these tools risk deepening mistrust in public institutions and further alienating vulnerable families.\n## Moving Forward: Protecting Every Child\u2019s Right to Learn\nTrauma, disrupted schooling, and the erosion of trust in institutions have long-term consequences for both individuals and the broader society. But hope remains in the resilient and compassionate responses from communities across the country, dedicated to keeping schools as safe spaces where everyone can learn.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released an updated version of its Artificial Intelligence (AI)\u2026\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/3a8ntXkq28s?si=fcTjXaG1iWOeVQYx Millions of people across the globe tuned into the draw for the 2026 FIFA\u2026\nWhen Border Patrol agents descended upon Charlotte, North Carolina last week, many wondered why they\u2026\n## Explore immigration data where you live", "Our Map the Impact tool has comprehensive coverage of more than 100 data points about immigrants and their contributions in all 50 states and the country overall.

Public schools in the U.S. are through a combination of state and local funding. Each state has its own formula for funding school districts, but they all are directly or indirectly based on the number of students served by a school district as determined through student attendance or enrollment. Schools in states that use attendance-based models to determine student counts for school funding may be particularly affected by increases in absenteeism or decreases in enrollment due to immigration-related fears. These states include California and Texas, which are home to the largest shares of school-aged children living in immigrant families. While the overall decrease in funding may be relatively small, school districts that serve large shares of students from immigrant families may be more heavily impacted by funding cuts.\n  * Schools may also face increased challenges addressing fears among children in immigrant families to prevent declines school performance and negative impacts on health.

KFF analysis shows that , or 19 million, children in the U.S. have an immigrant parent, and the vast majority of these children are U.S. citizens.

REUTERS/Daniel Cole \nThe Supreme Court affirmed in that children have a right to public education regardless of their immigration status and that states cannot enact policies or laws that deny immigrant youth\u2019s access to public schools. However, amid the Trump administration\u2019s , many states have taken actions that could threaten immigrant children\u2019s constitutional right to attend K-12 schools.\nIn this context, reports of fear, anxiety, and stress from and have been rampant. These reports have come even from communities that have historically been welcoming toward immigrant youth.\nHere, I examine the profile of immigrant youth in U.S. schools and the legislation that may threaten their access to an education. I also consider the impacts of increased immigration surveillance and anti-immigrant policies on youth and the schools that serve them.\n## Who are the immigrant youth enrolled in US public schools?\nOne challenge that educators and policymakers face is a lack of understanding\u2014and data\u2014about who immigrant children are, where they come from, and how much it costs to educate them. Due to privacy protections, schools do not collect data specifically on immigrant students. Instead, school systems estimate their number of immigrant students using enrollment numbers for English learners (ELs). These enrollment numbers are the basis for federal allocations for that are focused on supporting English learners and immigrant youth.", "However, using the count of ELs as a proxy for immigrant youth enrollment is far from perfect, as ELs include both foreign and native-born students. Most foreign-born students are Hispanic\u2014from Central or South America (about 54%)\u2014though U.S. public schools enroll a diverse group of immigrant children, including many from Asia (about 22%). Notably, of English learners in U.S. schools during the 2020-21 school year were \u201crecent immigrants\u201d who had been in the U.S. for three years or less. One implication is that while some actions and rhetoric may target immigrants in particular, many others will affect\u2014and, very likely, harm\u2014both immigrant and native-born students. \n## A barrage of policies targeting immigrant students\nOver the last few months, we have seen an extraordinary number of policies aimed at immigrant students, with many more that will have indirect effects on this population.\nAt the federal level, the Trump administration has sought to limit undocumented immigrants\u2019 access to , career education, and adult education programs. Most recently, a July 10, 2025, rule change would bar many immigrant families from , leaving an estimated vulnerable to losing early education, health, and nutritional services. Earlier in the summer, the administration also temporarily withheld in K-12 federal education grants, including Title III funds that support English learners and immigrant students. While Title III funds have been unfrozen as of August 2025, states and local districts still find themselves trying to navigate the administration\u2019s erratic policymaking. In my research, I have seen districts scramble to plan for defunding and avoid cuts in critical who serve immigrant youth and families (e.g., teachers and school-based mental health professionals).", "Meanwhile, several states have punished, or threatened to punish, districts that support the enrollment of immigrant children. Some states have proposed legislation that could threaten immigrant children\u2019s constitutional right to attend K-12 schools. This comes despite the unambiguous decision in Plyler that affords children a right to public education regardless of immigration status.\nI have been tracking this state-level activity in my (as have other policy and legal ). As of August 2025, I identified that have proposed legislation to ban undocumented students or punish districts that enroll immigrant students with precarious legal statuses (Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas). A few of these states have proposed multiple bills that threaten educational access for immigrant students (e.g., Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas). Although some of these bills have since initial data collection (e.g., in Indiana; SB036/HB0793 in Tennessee; in Texas), the outcome of others remains uncertain. With most legislative sessions adjourned until the fall, additional educational bills related to vouchers that exclude immigrant students and limits to other social and family benefits and services will be under consideration in the coming months.\nAs of August 2025, at least four states have introduced legislation that would require schools or parents to collect or report students\u2019 immigration status, raising serious concerns about data privacy and potential misuse. Additionally, some states have proposed tuition or enrollment restrictions that echo the very kinds of access barriers struck down in the Plyler v. Doe decision (e.g., Indiana-HB1394 and Tennessee-HB0793). This signals a direct legal challenge to immigrant children\u2019s right to public education. Louisiana\u2019s recent move () goes beyond challenging Plyler v. Doe\u2014it would permit the state to collect immigration status information from anyone seeking state services.", "## Anti-immigrant policies affect youth belonging, school attendance\nI have longstanding research partnerships with school districts and schools that largely enroll Hispanic students and language learners. The schools and communities that I partner with have witnessed ICE raids in workplaces, with direct implications for students\u2019 sense of belonging and mental health.

Other have drawn similar conclusions. Even as schools and districts attempt to combat youths\u2019 feelings of exclusion, many Hispanic youths, ELs, and children with foreign-born parents express feeling discriminated against when trying to access public benefits and social services due to their race/ethnicity and immigration status. They also report feeling unsafe in their communities due to fear of immigration enforcement and looming encounters with immigration courts or agents.

This accelerated response reflects several developments: the revocation of the \u201csensitive locations\u201d policy that previously limited U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities in educational settings, increased ICE presence in immigrant communities, and ongoing legal challenges in multiple states questioning the constitutional right to education of children regardless of immigration status, as established in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in .", "A review of the state and district documents released so far this year shows education leaders have developed guidance and policies in distinct ways, reflecting the variation in state and local political contexts and in approaches to structuring educational governance. Several states, through their department of education, state board, or attorney general\u2019s office, have released guidance to schools and districts on how to remain in compliance with federal and state law on the education of immigrant-background children and how to develop their own policies and procedures. These cover topics such as how to respond to ICE presence on school campuses and what level of student and parental information can be shared. To contextualize and support the guidance, state and district documents may include a purpose statement aligned with an existing institutional mission, a summary of relevant federal and state legal frameworks, direction for implementing specific protocols at the school level, and supplementary community resources and informational materials for staff and families.\nWhile these documents fulfill the basic function of for educators, many effectively connect these responsibilities to broader educational principles. Regardless of local political context, administrators can unite around policies that promote consistent attendance, minimize classroom disruptions, and encourage family engagement. Some safe zone resolutions leverage these policy frameworks to simultaneously reaffirm institutional commitments to educational access and celebrate community diversity. Others, including in Republican-led states and , keep their message directed on following existing law and policies upholding all students\u2019 right to attend school but stop short of advocating for immigrant communities more broadly.", "## The Legal Basis for Safe Zone Policies\nThe provisions in existing safe zone policies are based on established law and supported by research on effective school climates. Primary legal support stems from:\n  * The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that free, public education must be made available to all children regardless of immigration status, and schools must not engage in practices that might discourage enrollment or attendance due to how families are classified under immigration law.\n  * _Fourth Amendment to the Constitution._ Law enforcement agents are required to have a warrant signed by a judge, not just an administrative warrant issued by their own agency, to investigate or detain a person who is in a location where he or she has an expectation of privacy, including the private areas of a school.\n  * _Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)._ Information about individual students can only be disclosed to third parties with a legitimate educational purpose or with parent/guardian consent; however, this excludes \u201cdirectory information,\u201d which may include students\u2019 home addresses.\n  * _Civil Rights Act of 1964_ A school that fails to prevent bullying and harassment of students based on national origin may violate students\u2019 civil rights.", "These legal protections for children from immigrant families align with extensive research on what makes schools truly effective for all students. Schools that actively foster a , implement strategies to , and create meaningful opportunities for consistently demonstrate stronger academic achievement outcomes among their students. Additionally, a 2022 study found [safe zone policies to be associated with better academic outcomes](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9996116/) for children who had experienced or were at risk of parental deportation, with particular benefits owing to policies limiting ICE access to schools and offering counseling on immigration-related issues.\nGuidance Provisions Related to Immigration Enforcement\nWith the recent retraction of ICE\u2019s sensitive locations memo (which had largely decreed schools, faith-based institutions, and hospitals off-limits to immigration enforcement), educators are eager to understand their legal obligations and what limitations their schools can impose on ICE operations on campus. Safe zone guidance typically describes the legal boundaries within which school systems must operate, while reflecting the community\u2019s broader priorities and ethical framework.\nGuidance documents describe what school staff should do if ICE agents (or others conducting immigration enforcement) arrive on campus. Procedures lay out the roles and responsibilities of school personnel, including the chain of command for decision-making and how to notify parents or guardians of ICE activity. Some also provide an example of the difference between an administrative and judicial warrant.\nThe same policies for ICE encounters also typically include procedures for responding to in-person or virtual requests for information from ICE or law enforcement and for notifying parents of those requests. Policies may also discuss what information may be made available to school resource officers, who are law enforcement employees stationed in schools.", "Additionally, safe zone policies may limit what information schools are permitted to collect and retain. For example, schools must collect information from newly enrolled students about their place of birth and school history to identify recent immigrant children for federal funding purposes, but they may choose to retain only the identifier used to count such children in school data systems and not the underlying data collected to identify them as recent immigrants.\nSome safe zone policies direct schools and districts to review FERPA procedures, such as annual privacy notifications. As part of this, schools can update how they define directory information to protect sensitive data, such as a student\u2019s address and place of birth. Schools might additionally be requested to review what opportunities they offer parents to opt out of the release of directory data and place limits on to whom this information may be released.\nGuidance Provisions Related to Communication and Engagement\nState and local guidance generally includes suggestions on clearly communicating policies related to children from immigrant families to both parents/guardians and school staff.\nGiven the swiftly changing policy landscape and the high stakes, guidance often directs schools to update parent and backup caretaker contact information to be used if one or both parents are detained. Going further, California\u2019s guidance reflects rules in its that direct schools to exhaust parental instructions regarding emergency care before calling Child Protective Services."]}]}]}

Plotting visas and migrant apprehensions as a share of the nation\u2019s working-age population, reinforces the point that immigration is slowing in both absolute and relative terms. \n### More on Immigration from the Bush Institute\n[A NATION BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS](https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/resources-reports/reports/immigration.html) America is strengthened by the contributions from immigrants.

During and after World War II, Mexican immigrants were instrumental in alleviating shortages arising from the war effort. During the oil boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was record migration to Texas. In the 1990s, it was the fast-growing South and Mountain West states that received immigrants, many for the first time.\nIn terms of occupations, immigrants flowed into high-tech jobs during the Internet boom and construction jobs during the 2000s housing boom.\n> Immigrants grease the wheels of the labor market by flowing into industries and areas where there is a relative need for workers \u2014 where bottlenecks or shortages might otherwise damp growth.", "In 2013, the George W. Bush Institute honored America\u2019s immigrant heritage with an official immigration naturalization ceremony and a half-day event. \nIn addition, the rise in high-skilled immigration, a pronounced trend since the 1990s, has been linked to innovation, specifically to higher patenting rates among immigrants. Interestingly, greater innovation among immigrants appears to boost it among natives, too. Immigrants innovate more than natives because they are concentrated in STEM occupations where there is lots of R&D and entrepreneurial activity\nForty-four percent of medical scientists are foreign born, for example, as are 42 percent of computer software developers. Immigrant workers are also overrepresented among college professors, engineers, mathematicians, nurses, doctors and dentists, to name a few.\nIf immigration makes the economy larger, more efficient and productive, what\u2019s the problem? Why do we, as a nation, strictly limit immigration?\nThe Bush Insttitue hosted a naturalization ceremony honoring 20 new citizens from 12 countries, July 10, 2013. (Grant Miller / George W. Bush Presidential Center)\nImmigration changes factor prices \u2014 it lowers the wages of competing workers, while raising the return to capital and the wages of complementary workers. In other words, the immigration surplus does not accrue equally to everyone. It goes primarily to the owners of capital, which includes business and land-owners and investors.\nComplementary workers also benefit. The demand for these workers rises with more immigration. They may be construction supervisors, translators, pharmaceutical reps, or immigration lawyers. And consumers benefit from the lower prices of the goods and services that immigrants produce. But competing workers\u2019 wages fall, at least in the initial transition period as the economy adjusts to the new labor inflow.", "Research suggests that previous immigrants suffer more of the adverse wage effects than do natives. Prior immigrants are more like current immigrants.\nResearch also suggests any negative wage effects are concentrated among low-skilled and not high-skilled workers. Perhaps that is because high-skilled U.S.-born workers are complementary to immigrants to a greater extent than native low-skilled workers, who hold jobs that require less education and fewer language skills.\n## Overall, we are talking about a plus\nLast year, the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the George W. Bush Institute partnered to release this book containing an in-depth analysis of the correlation between immigration and economic growth. \nImmigration is thus a positive but also disruptive change. There are lots of historical examples of positive yet disruptive economic change. The Industrial Revolution displaced millions of farm workers and resulted in the great urban migrations and the birth of mega-cities to which we now ascribe all kinds of positive attributes, including creativity and innovation and higher wages. \nNo great change is without some short-term cost. What is costly in the long-term is preventing market forces from funneling resources to their best use. The adjustment of wages and prices to the changing demand and supply in the economy are the levers of capitalism that direct resources to their best allocation.\nImmigration has net benefits. The fact that it has some costs is not a reason to bar it, but rather to manage it. Mechanisms can be found to benefit from immigration\u2019s gains while making up for the losses of some workers. International trade has similar effects, and workers adversely affected by trade are eligible for federal programs such as Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n> Immigration has net benefits. The fact that it has some costs is not a reason to bar it, but rather to manage it.", "International migration is not much different than domestic migration, at least not in terms of economics. We Texans often celebrate Californians and others who move to Texas for the abundant jobs, lower house prices and lesser tax burden. In Texas, we have depended on this inflow of labor from other states to grow as fast as we have \u2014 about twice as fast as the nation since 1990. The state has benefited from the migration as have those who moved here.\nWould wages have been higher without the inflow of labor? Perhaps temporarily. But wage inflation and skill shortages would have choked off investment and firms would have expanded elsewhere, in places where they could readily find more competitively priced resources.\nImmigration is a net positive, even for those who don\u2019t move, but the gains are not distributed equally.

The impact of immigrant workers is large at both the low- and high-skill ends of the labor force. Immigrants represent a high share of workers in many low-wage, manual labor sectors of the economy. At the same time, immigrants contribute importantly to high-level technical skills and entrepreneurial energy. Most recently, however, government policies have aimed at drastically curtailing the inflow of immigrants and increasing the outflows of foreign-born persons. What are the different ways that this shift might impact the US economy?\n> The recent decline in immigration could adversely affect the economy through multiple channels, short term and long term.", "* High rates of immigration have driven a fivefold increase in theliving in the United States over the past six decades. All told, the number of immigrants rose to 53.3 million in January 2025 (about 15.8 percent of the population), up from under 10 million in 1965 (about 5 percent of the population). High rates of immigration in part reflected legislation in the 1960s that opened pathways to legal immigration to a much wider and diverse set of countries. Since 2000, the population of highly-educated foreign-born workers grew at an especially strong rate, as they were well-placed to obtain permanent residence status and then naturalization (see ). More recently, since 2021, there was a sharp increase in the population of unauthorized immigrants (those without full legal status, which includes people who entered the United States illegally and people who were allowed to enter through the use of parole authority and who may be awaiting proceedings in immigration court.) As COVID-related restrictions on border crossings were eased, many immigrants received temporary paroles or deportation protection as asylum seekers, victims of crime and violence, and refugees from countries facing war and natural disasters. The estimated population of unauthorized immigrants jumped from 10.2 million in 2019 to a record high of [Looking at the 2023 foreign-born population](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/08/21/key-findings-about-us-immigrants/) (the last year for which complete data is available), 46 percent were naturalized U.S. citizens, 27 percent were lawful residents with permanent or temporary residence permits, and 27 percent were without full legal status (of which 40 percent had parole or some other form of protected status).", "* However, recent shifts in government policies have led to a sharp reversal in net immigration flows, as the number of new immigrants has been sharply curtailed and aggressive actions have been taken to repatriate unauthorized immigrants living in the United States. The annual net flow of immigrants peaked at 3.4 million people in 2023, far above the previous peak of over 1.5 million in 2014 (see chart). Starting in mid-2024, however, entries through the various asylum and parole programs were limited by the Biden administration. Since January 2025, the [Trump administration has gone further](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/immigration-policy-and-its-macroeconomic-effects-in-the-second-trump-administration/) in removing deportation protections, rescinding work permits, stopping accepting asylum applications, halting the release of immigrants encountered at the border, while intensifying repatriation efforts of unauthorized immigrants living in the United States. There is a high degree of uncertainty in the estimates for net immigration flows for 2025. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 2025 that net immigration would still be positive but drop sharply to 0.4 million (see chart). Other estimates suggest a decline of foreign-born people living in the United States. For instance, according to a Pew Research Center , the total number of foreign-born persons living in the United States dropped by over 1.4 million from January 2025 to July 2025, although the [decline may be exaggerated by](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/seeing-economic-data-through-fog-immigration-estimates) increasing reluctance of unauthorized immigrants to participate in population surveys.", "* As the share of foreign-born workers has risen, variations in net immigration rates have substantial consequences for the U.S. workforce. Since 1995, the population of foreign-born workers has grown 2.8 percent per year and the native born by only 0.6 percent per year. In consequence, net immigration has accounted for close to half of labor force growth, pushing the share of foreign-born workers up to 19.2 percent of the work force in 2024 from under 12 percent in 1995 (). The growing importance of immigrants in the labor force is a result of immigration trends, but it is also a reflection of the [increasing retirement of the baby boom generation](https://leowealth.com/insights/what-is-the-impact-of-accelerating-baby-boomer-retirements/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20is%20witnessing%20an,to%20roughly%2058%25%20by%202030.)", "* A sharp slowing or even reversal of the growth of the U.S. labor force would have a significant negative impact on employment and GDP growth. The speed at which the economy can grow over a longer horizon is determined by changes in the total amount people are working \u2014 which involves both the number of workers in the labor force and the hours they work \u2014 and the efficiency with which they produce goods and services. Estimates of the negative impact of a reduction of labor force growth on GDP growth depend on the assumptions made on the drop in net migration, but the order of magnitude is similar across studies. A recent AEI  of this impact was based on projections that the net change in the population of immigrants over age 16 will be in the range of -525,000 to 115,000 in 2025, down from 2.2 million in 2024. The analysis suggested that this shift would reduce GDP growth in 2025 by 0.3 - 0.4 percentage points as potential growth in employment is cut from 140,000-180,000 jobs a month in 2024 to 10,000-40,000 jobs a month in the second half of 2025.

From May to June, after weeks of immigration worksite raids in Southern California and other parts of the state, the total workforce in California dropped by 3.1%, while the number of noncitizens showing up to work dropped by 7.2%. This reflects not only the direct impact of deportations, but the fears that immigration enforcement operations have created in communities, leading some people not to show up to work. According to the researchers, this represents the largest shrinking of the California workforce since the Great Recession.", "Raids in California also led to significant drops in student attendance at schools.

A from Economic Insights and Research Consulting found that deportations are already having an impact on the agricultural supply and on the construction industry. The 10 states with the highest concentration of undocumented immigrants in the construction industry saw a 0.1% drop in construction employment at a time when other states saw a 1.9% increase. The hospitality industry also showed a huge drop in growth, with the labor force rising just 0.2% in June 2025, compared to 1.5% in June 2024.\nSimilarly, according to the same , the agricultural industry saw a total drop in employment of 155,000 workers from March 2025 to July 2025 \u2014 compared to a 2.2% in March 2024 to July 2024. While the researchers cautioned that it was too early to draw firm conclusions, they noted that the cost of fresh vegetables and meat (both beef and pork) rose by a similar rate over that period, suggesting upwards price pressures may be caused by labor force disruption due to Trump\u2019s immigration operations.\nIndividual examples of businesses show that immigration raids and the stripping of legal status are having an impact around the country:\n  * In , 200 workers at a meatpacking plant who had legal status under the Biden administration had to be terminated after Trump stripped their status.", "* In , after a DHS raid in a meatpacking plant where half the employees were arrested, recruitment plummeted, and the plant had to cut back on production at a time when ground beef prices are already rising.\n  * In , one local grocery story serving the Latino community has seen a 20% drop in customer traffic and sales volume.\n  * In , food trucks and other businesses that cater to the immigrant population are seeing a major drop in customers.\n  * In , a major commercial warehouse and shipping hub shuttered for days following an I-9 audit and a worksite raid.\n  * In , a raid at a dairy farm that led to the arrest of 11 employees caused the company to shut down temporarily.", "Critically, when hiring their employees, many of the employers in this situation had used E-Verify\u2014an internet-based system that compares information entered by an employee on an I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form with U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) records.

Our review reveals three central themes. First, although immigration law is considered federal civil law, immigration enforcement has become substantially intertwined with criminal law enforcement in ways that have broad-ranging and radiating effects on immigrant communities of color. Second, race plays an important bidirectional role in the increasing criminalization of immigration. Specifically, criminalizing immigration results in the racialization of certain immigrant groups as dangerous outsiders, and such racialization has the effect of sustaining and promoting the policies and practices that target or have a disproportionate impact on certain immigrant groups. Third, given the increased externalization of US immigration enforcement programs, the effects of the criminalization of immigration are not limited to the United States. Each of these dynamics operates across multiple sites and in various components of the immigration enforcement system to disproportionately affect immigrants racialized as non-White in the United States. We discuss the important gaps in research and policy implications that follow from our review.", "This article presents a critical review and analysis of social scientific research from the past fifteen years on the criminalization of immigration in the United States. The criminalization of immigration broadly refers to the proliferating intersections of criminal law and immigration law, including the increasing role of criminal legal system actors in immigration enforcement and the expanded reliance on purportedly civil systems and structures that are deployed and experienced as punitive (Chac\u00f3n ; Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez ; Stumpf ). This development has resulted in a dramatic rise in federal criminal prosecution of immigration violations and a significant expansion of the type of criminal offenses that can trigger detention, deportation, and bars to reentry. Our review and analysis focus on the immigration scholarship that illuminates the direct and indirect ways that race shapes and sustains current US detention and deportation policies and practices. This scholarship also explores various ways that these policies and practices have generated and reproduced racial disparities and inequalities across time and space. An important insight from this body of research is the bidirectional role that race plays in the increasing criminalization of immigration. By bidirectional role, we mean that criminalizing immigration results in the racialization of certain immigrant groups as dangerous outsiders, and such racialization has the effect of sustaining and promoting the policies and practices that target or have a disproportionate impact on certain immigrant groups, particularly those from Mexico and Central America.", "Understanding the criminalization of immigration and its impacts on communities of color is essential when studying the nature and consequences of the operation of the contemporary criminal justice system. As Sara Wakefield and Kristin Turney (, this issue) emphasize in their discussion of the rise of the carceral state in the United States, one defining feature of the modern criminal legal system is the spread of its carceral logic and practices into institutions that appear seemingly unrelated to the criminal justice system. Katherine Beckett and Naomi Murakawa () have described the policy and institutional innovations that underlie this phenomenon as the \u201cshadow carceral state.\u201d The contemporary immigration enforcement system, including the asylum system, which relies on and perpetuates the criminalization of immigration, is a paradigmatic example of the shadow carceral state (see Ryo ). Therefore, a more complete and expansive understanding of racial disparities in criminal case processing and dispositions (see Bushway et al. , this issue), policing (Dovidio and Solomon , this issue), collateral consequences of contacts with the criminal justice system (Lee et al. , this issue), and reentry post-incarceration (Nahra et al. , this issue) requires attending to complex issues related to the criminalization of immigration.", "Our focus on research from the past fifteen years is timely and important for at least two reasons. First, the past decade and a half are a critical period of study for our understanding of the role of race in shaping the experiences and outcomes for immigrants in our criminal justice and immigration enforcement systems. Immigration law and policy in the United States have long histories of discrimination and exclusion based on race (Chac\u00f3n ; Chin ; Molina ; Ngai ). Yet, legal scholars and social scientists have critiqued migration scholarship as failing to grapple adequately with the influence of race on immigration law (Johnson ). In response, recent scholarship across multiple disciplines has examined how contemporary US immigration laws and policies continue to subjugate immigrants of color\u2014particularly Latinos\u2014even as these laws and policies have become facially race-neutral or \u201ccolor-blind\u201d (Aranda and Vaquera ; Douglas et al. ; Kibria et al. ; Vazquez )."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "d1d04bcc-4290-56aa-904e-d8ab6e343690", "url": "https://cis.org/Report/Weaknesses-Immigration-Vetting", "title": "Weaknesses in Immigration Vetting", "excerpts": ["## Passing a background check doesn't mean a clean record\n_Robert Law is the director of regulatory affairs and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies._\nLegislative proposals to amnesty illegal aliens usually require an alien to pass \u201cnational security and background checks\u201d as part of the eligibility requirements. The ability to properly and thoroughly screen and vet aliens \u2014 whether seeking amnesty or any other immigration benefit \u2014 is necessary to ensure that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) adjudicators only approve benefits for those who are eligible.\nBut there is a general misunderstanding of what national security and background checks entail. To be clear, passing a background check does not mean that the alien has a clean criminal record or that derogatory information revealed by these checks will prevent all ineligible or inadmissible applicants from obtaining an immigration benefit. In fact, in the context of the amnesty proposals, an alien could be inadmissible on a criminal ground but still \u201cpass\u201d a background check. This examines the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) authority to conduct immigration vetting and highlights areas where disturbing gaps exist in current practice.\n## DHS Authority to Collect Biometrics\nCurrent DHS regulations authorize the collection of biometrics (such as fingerprints) for administering immigration and naturalization benefits requests as well as administering and enforcing immigration laws. For example, any applicant, petitioner, sponsor, beneficiary, or individual filing a benefit request may be required to appear for biometrics collection. (.) Additionally, DHS has the authority to require the submission of biometric information to conduct background and security checks and perform functions related to administering and enforcing U.S. immigration laws. (.)", "While DHS clearly has the authority to collect biometrics from any applicant, petitioner, sponsor, beneficiary, requestor, or individual seeking a benefit or generally enforcing the immigration and naturalization laws, the Department does not fully utilize this authority. Instead, the submission of biometrics is only mandatory for certain benefit requests and enforcement actions.\nThe current practice for expanding biometrics collection beyond the enumerated list of benefit types places an onerous burden on USCIS. As explained in the , for all other benefit requests, \u201cDHS must decide, in accordance with its statutory and regulatory authorities, if the request or enforcement action justifies collection of biometrics and notify the individual where they will be collected when a collection is warranted and for what purposes they will be used.\u201d Given these hurdles, USCIS rarely attempts to expand mandated biometric collection beyond the currently enumerated list of benefit types.\n## Current Types of Background Checks USCIS Performs\nGenerally, there are three different types of background checks that USCIS runs, with each yielding different types of information.", "IDENT is the automated biometrics identification system used to check biometric identifiers (i.e., fingerprints/photographs) against other databases. While this system has the ability to yield useful information relevant to immigration benefits eligibility, USCIS receives incomplete or outdated details back from the FBI. Because the FBI does not consider USCIS a criminal justice agency, the information that USCIS receives from the FBI is either incomplete or inadequate compared to what is provided to ICE and CBP on the same alien. As a result, for immigration benefits the FBI is merely running a cursory search that is the equivalent of the background check run on an applicant seeking a job at a fast food restaurant. This current practice is obviously problematic because it deprives USCIS officers of the complete picture of the alien\u2019s criminal history. As a result, USCIS may treat the absence of derogatory information as if there is no derogatory information and approve an immigration benefit for an ineligible alien.\nThe FBI name check is a name and date of birth vetting system. Currently, USCIS only uses this form of vetting for seven or eight benefit types. However, the investigative check is based on the name and date of birth the applicant or petitioner. This \u201chonor system\u201d structure is inherently vulnerable to exploitation as the check does not search for all variations of the applicant\u2019s name and date of birth. Even if all provided name and date of birth variations were run by USCIS, there is no guarantee the applicant provided all aliases and previously used identities. This form of vetting is particularly ineffective for amnesty applicants who have a history of breaking U.S. immigration laws, and possibly others, and are less likely to provide truthful and accurate information compared to aliens seeking legal immigration benefits.\n### 3. TECS (Treasury Enforcement Communications System)", "TECS also runs biographical information (name/date of birth) but, unlike the FBI name check, includes all aliases and prior names. TECS checks for warrants and the \u201cno fly\u201d list, but this form of vetting is largely not criminal in nature. While generally focused on fraud and national security, the downside is TECS can produce a lot of false positive results that take time for adjudicators to sort through.\n## Vulnerabilities in Current Immigration Vetting\nPresently, the Department of Homeland Security lacks a uniform definition of \u201cbackground checks\u201d or the term \u201cbiometrics\u201d. As USCIS flagged in the biometrics proposed rule, the vagueness surrounding DHS\u2019s approach to background checks injects substantial vulnerability into vetting. In the rule\u2019s preamble, the agency wrote:\n> DHS has decided that the more limited focus on background checks and document production is outdated because immigration benefit request adjudication and the enforcement and administration of immigration laws include verifying identity and determining whether or not the individual poses a risk to national security or public safety. DHS has decided that it is necessary to increase routine biometric collections to include individuals associated with immigration benefits and to perform other function related to administering and enforcing the immigration and naturalization laws. Therefore, DHS proposes in this rule that any applicant, petitioner, sponsor, beneficiary, or individual filing or associated with a certain benefit or request, including U.S. citizens and without regard to age, must appear for biometrics collection unless DHS waives or exempts the requirement.", "Additionally, USCIS has historically not referred fraud findings very frequently. [As the 1986 amnesty showed](https://cis.org/Report/Bailout-Illegal-Immigrants-Lessons-Implementation-1986-IRCA-Amnesty), fraudulent applications were prevalent and a lot of ineligible illegal aliens were legalized. There is no reason to expect this practice to change under the Biden administration for fraudulent applications of any type of immigration benefit.\nUSCIS adjudicators and fraud detection officers are highly skilled, but they lack all of the necessary resources to thoroughly vet all aliens seeking immigration benefits. If DHS is serious about benefits integrity, [it should promptly publish the USCIS biometrics final rule](https://cis.org/Law/Modernizing-Biometrics-Collection-Immigration-Vetting). This rulemaking originated under the Trump administration and cleared every Administrative Procedure Act hurdle except for publication in the Federal Register before the change in administration. If implemented, that rule would increase the biometric modalities that DHS collects, including iris image, palm print, and voice print. Each of these biometric modalities serves a useful purpose at various stages in the vetting process. As DHS stated in the USCIS biometrics proposed rule, this regulatory change will provide DHS with:\n> the flexibility to change its biometrics collection practices and policies to ensure that necessary adjustments can be made to meet emerging needs, enhance the use of biometrics beyond background checks and document production to include identity verification and management in the immigration lifecycle, enhance vetting to lessen the dependence on paper documents to prove identity and familial relationships, preclude imposters, and improve the consistency in biometrics terminology within DHS."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "5b0adf26-4762-57c9-aeb9-6503da218c9f", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094119021000772", "title": "The effect of immigration enforcement on crime reporting", "excerpts": ["#  The effect of immigration enforcement on crime reporting: Evidence from Dallas\nAuthor links open overlay panel\nMistrust between immigrants and the police may undermine law enforcement\u2019s ability to keep communities safe. This paper documents that immigration policies affect an individual\u2019s willingness to report crime. I analyze the 2015 Priority Enforcement Program, which focused immigration enforcement on individuals convicted of serious crimes and shifted resources away from immigration-related offenses. I use data from the Dallas Police Department that include a complainant\u2019s ethnicity to show that the number of violent and property crimes reported to the police by Hispanics increased by 4 percent after the introduction of PEP. These results suggest that reducing enforcement of individuals who do not pose a threat to public safety can potentially improve trust between immigrant communities and the police.\nThe ability of law enforcement officials to detect and sanction criminal behavior depends on a community\u2019s willingness to report crime. However, unauthorized immigrants or people living near unauthorized immigrants might fear that contact with the police could result in law enforcement learning about an individual\u2019s immigration status (see for example, Lake et al., 2013). Under-reporting of crime can make it more difficult for police departments to prevent and solve crimes, leading to a misallocation of resources and inhibiting investigation or prosecution of offenders (Langton et al., 2012). Yet, a majority of crimes\u2014even serious violent crimes\u2014often go unreported.", "Immigrants\u2019 hesitancy to contact the police likely stems from federal immigration programs (i.e., the 287(g) and Secure Communities programs) that established cooperation between local law enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. Indeed, as the number of detentions and deportations rose between 2008 and 2014 as a result of Secure Communities, a number of police departments expressed that worsening relations with the Hispanic community was making them less effective. \nAs one illustration of this concern, former Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department William J. Bratton remarked:\n> Keeping America\u2019s neighborhoods safe requires our police forces to have the trust and help of everyone in our communities. My nearly 40 years in law enforcement and my experience as Police Commissioner in Boston and New York City and as Chief in Los Angeles has taught me this. Yet every day our effectiveness is diminished because immigrants living and working in our communities are afraid to have any contact with the police. [...] My officers can\u2019t prevent or solve crimes if victims or witnesses are unwilling to talk to us because of the fear of being deported. [...] We can\u2019t solve crimes that aren\u2019t reported because the victims are afraid to come forward to the police.\nMany local jurisdictions began limiting their cooperation with ICE, which eventually convinced DHS to suspend the Secure Communities program in November of 2014.", "This paper studies whether the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP)\u2014a federal program that was launched in 2015 to rebuild trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities\u2014changed the degree to which Hispanic individuals reported incidents to the police. Under PEP, the agency no longer sought to detain individuals with immigration offenses alone, and instead only focused on detaining individuals convicted of significant criminal offenses. In reducing the number of circumstances under which it could detain individuals, ICE attempted to re-establish the cooperation that it lost during the height of Secure Communities with state and local jurisdictions.\nBy redefining ICE\u2019s priorities to only focus on individuals who posed a threat to public safety, PEP reduced the likelihood that an unauthorized immigrant who had not committed a crime would be detained or deported, thereby reducing the cost of reporting an incident to the police. However, PEP did not lower the probability that an immigrant who was convicted of a serious crime would be detained. For these reasons, PEP\u2014unlike most other immigration policies\u2014directly increased the incentives for Hispanic victims to report incidents, without simultaneously increasing the incentives for offenders to commit a serious crime.", "To quantify the impact of this program on the crime reporting behavior of Hispanic individuals, I use administrative data from the Dallas Police Department (DPD). This incident-level dataset from the DPD is relatively unique in that it includes information about a complainant\u2019s race and Hispanic ethnicity as well as his or her full name. Using this information, I employ a difference-in-differences strategy, in which I estimate how Hispanic complainants\u2019 reporting behavior changed relative to reporting by non-Hispanic complainants in the same neighborhood (i.e., Census tract) after the introduction of PEP. In addition to the richness of its policing data, Dallas is a useful setting for evaluating this policy because slightly more than 40 percent of the population is Hispanic and the vast majority of neighborhoods are at least 20 percent Hispanic. Moreover, roughly 20\u201325 percent of Dallas County\u2019s Hispanic population is unauthorized immigrants (U.S. Census Bureau, Migration Policy Institute).\nUsing this identification strategy, I find that after PEP was launched, the number of serious crimes reported to the police by Hispanic complainants increased by around 4 percent (relative to the mean of 15 crimes in a tract per quarter). A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that during the year and a half that PEP was in effect, the DPD was notified of around 1200 more serious crimes than it would have been otherwise. Importantly, increased reporting might have dissuaded offenders from committing crimes against Hispanic individuals, so if anything, I am biased against finding an increase in Hispanics\u2019 crime reporting, and these figures are likely conservative estimates of the policy\u2019s effect. The results are robust to the definition of neighborhood used as well as to the identification of Hispanic complainants using names (as opposed to using the race/ethnicity recorded by the DPD).", "In the last part of the paper, I consider alternative explanations for the increase in Hispanic-reported incidents following the implementation of PEP: namely, a rise in the underlying crime rates of Hispanic offenders (who often commit crimes against other Hispanic individuals) and growth of the Hispanic population. Specifically, I use data on arrests and suspects from the DPD to show that the share of arrestees and suspects who were Hispanic stayed relatively constant over this time period. These results suggest that the increase in reported crime was likely not driven by Hispanic individuals committing more crimes, which is consistent with the program\u2019s goal of prioritizing the detainment of serious criminal offenders. I then use the American Community Survey as well as data on school enrollment to show that there was not a sudden influx of Hispanic individuals into Dallas that could explain the increase in Hispanic complainants."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "5945c1e8-9d6a-5342-a524-507d7270def2", "url": "https://www.backgroundchecks.com/criminal-background-checks/background-check-gaps-at-the-us-border?srsltid=AfmBOoqL6e0SOoS3koy_6SEGovd3uVs3NAElP93EYn0c-7lmFuAGWAgD", "title": "Background Check Gaps at the US Border", "excerpts": ["Background Check Gaps at the US Border\nThorough background checks are essential in the hiring process.

Contrary to early fears, no great backlash against foreigners occurred. The vocal minority championing closed borders and a crackdown on illegal immigrants has no more influence today than it had on Sept. 10, 2001.\nFor a brief time after Sept. 11, Americans did support limiting immigration. Since then, however, support for immigration has returned to pre-attack levels.\nA December 2001 CBS News/New York Times poll found that more than half of Americans believe immigrants contribute to this country, up from 29 percent in 1994. According to a June 2002 Gallup Poll, a majority of the public believes that immigration is good for the country.\nAmericans still worry about their security and about the high rates of illegal immigration. In general, however, they do not conflate the two. The public has some sympathy for those who entered the country illegally and is reluctant to single out for punishment or deportation people who are working hard and otherwise abiding by the nation\u2019s laws.\nAll the more troubling then that some of the most reactionary thinking on immigration has emanated not from the public at large, but from Attorney General John Ashcoft\u2019s Justice Department.\nFor his part, President Bush deserves some credit for the absence of a backlash against immigrants. No surprise there since his instincts on the subject have always been good. During the 2000 presidential campaign, he made a point of ignoring the anti-immigrant voices in his own party. Family values, he often pointed out, don\u2019t stop at America\u2019s borders.", "In the wake of Sept. 11, Bush has urged Americans to live up to their values of tolerance and mutual respect. His recent trip to Detroit was one in a series of highly visible White House efforts to reach out to and reassure Arab and Muslim Americans, even at the risk of angering some voters.\nBut the attorney general has sounded an odd note in the president\u2019s efforts to prevent foreigners from being demonized. Determined not to allow another terrorist attack, Ashcroft has proposed several initiatives that target immigrants without offering Americans much additional security in return.\nFor more than a year, Ashcroft has pushed plans to authorize the FBI and state and local police to arrest illegal immigrants. Previously, only specially trained INS officers were authorized to make such arrests.\nThis idea sounds sensible enough but is unlikely to add much to our security, and may even detract from it. All 19 Sept. 11 hijackers entered the United States legally, and 17 still had valid visas at the time of the attacks.\nWith so few visa-violating terrorists to find, police efforts will inevitably target ordinary illegal immigrants. This will have the perverse result of making it harder for police to earn the trust of immigrant communities. People worried that they will be questioned about their immigration status aren\u2019t likely to provide law enforcement with information about criminals and terrorists operating in their midst.\nAlso troubling is Ashcroft\u2019s ruling late last month that asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants can be held without hearing or bail on the grounds that they potentially threaten national security. How? Because keeping track of them diverts government time, money and attention away from homeland security.\nBut declaring entire categories of immigrants to be potential national security threats when other screening procedures exist to weed out criminals and terrorists is bad policy and a waste of taxpayer money.", "Further, Ashcroft\u2019s decision strains America\u2019s already fraying asylum system. In 2002, cumbersome INS policies kept tens of thousands of legitimate refugees from claiming asylum in the United States. The Justice Department\u2019s new policy will further undercut a program that has been a beacon of American democracy for a half century.\nThe new policy also raises questions about America\u2019s commitment to civil liberties. The U.S. Constitution protects individuals from being held without formal charges and presumes their innocence until proven guilty. But Ashcroft\u2019s ruling suggests that asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants have no such rights and are therefore more like the al-Qaeda enemy combatants housed at the U.S. base in Guantanamo.\nPresident Bush should reconsider his attorney general\u2019s initiatives. A wiser approach to tackling his legitimate concerns about illegal immigration would be to revive the initiative the White House was preparing in summer 2001 to overhaul the temporary work visa program for Mexican nationals. Worries about abuses of the refugee program can be better handled by enhancing the system of courts that hear asylum cases.\nSteps such as these will make Americans more secure without needlessly jeopardizing American values. If President Bush takes these steps, the polls show that the American people will back him.\nThe Brookings Institution is committed to quality, independence, and impact. We are supported by a .

The Supreme Court upheld these restrictions. I reinstated these successful policies in Executive Order 14161 of January 20, 2025 (Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats), and Proclamation 10949 of June 4, 2025 (Restricting the Entry of Foreign Nationals To Protect the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats).\nIt is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security and public safety, incite hate crimes, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\nThe United States must exercise extreme vigilance during the visa-issuance and immigration processes to identify, prior to their admission or entry into the United States, foreign nationals who intend to harm Americans or our national interests. The United States Government must ensure that admitted aliens do not intend to threaten its citizens; undermine or destabilize its culture, government, institutions, or founding principles; or advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists or other threats to our national security.", "In order to protect our Nation, as directed in Executive Order 14161, the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, identified countries throughout the world for which screening and vetting information was so deficient as to warrant a full or partial suspension of the admission of nationals from those countries pursuant to section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1182(f). Accordingly, in Proclamation 10949, I restricted the entry of foreign nationals into the United States from countries with deficient screening and vetting information to protect the national security and public safety of the United States and its people. The proclamation also directed the United States Government to immediately engage countries identified in the proclamation on measures that must be taken to comply with the screening, vetting, immigration, and security requirements of the United States.", "Despite those engagements, most of the countries identified in Proclamation 10949, as well as others, continue to exhibit woeful inadequacies in screening, vetting, and provision of information. At least one country lacks mechanisms in hospitals to ensure births are reported, and widespread corruption, combined with a general lack of vetting and poor recordkeeping, result in any non-citizen being able to obtain any civil document from that country, particularly if that person is willing to pay a fee or engage an individual that specializes in assisting in such fraud. In that same country, law enforcement records are not maintained with the accuracy or consistency necessary to provide representations of individuals\u2019 criminal histories to the United States Government. In another country, civil documents like marriage licenses and birth certificates are handwritten and stamped on regular paper, making them highly susceptible to alteration, and there is a fraudulent document market that produces all types of falsified records, making written corroboration of any visa application practically impossible. In yet another country, criminal records are widely unreliable and inaccessible. And in another, United States visas are used as a tool for illicit transborder movement of assets by corrupt government officials and organized criminal groups. Corruption in another country even extends to the national school system, which has provided falsified diplomas and grade information in the past to fraudsters who have tried to obtain student visas and eligibility for large athletic scholarships. The government of another country refuses to provide passport exemplars, undermining the United States Government\u2019s ability to detect fraudulent documents. In another country, the population, for the most part, does not formally document life events", ". This makes effective verification of basic biographical data such as birthdates, marriages, and parentage exceedingly difficult, if not impossible. Such countries warrant continued or new travel restrictions.", "Further, after continuing their review, and in light of the experience gained since the issuance of Proclamation 10949 and the reaction of foreign countries to the issuance of that proclamation, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have identified additional countries that cannot meet basic criteria for identifying their nationals and residents who pose national security and public safety threats and for sharing information with the United States. For example, only 40 percent of one country\u2019s territory is under complete government control, and officials there have noted that their ability to securely process, house, or monitor non citizens is constrained. In another country, corruption in various forms is pervasive. Other countries have been subject to successful efforts to overthrow or undermine their governments, with the result that radical terrorist groups operate with minimal, if any, interference from law enforcement, engaging in forced labor, sex trafficking, illegal drug manufacturing and distribution, and other activities that destabilize such countries. And, because of the poor documentation practices and corrupt governments in these countries, there can be little assurance that the foreign nationals from these countries who seek to come to America on immigrant or nonimmigrant visas are not bringing these criminal enterprises with them to the United States."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "f8ca833a-09b1-5128-84f9-27a69ddfb5f2", "url": "https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/immigration-us-national-security-since-911", "title": "Research: Immigration and U.S. National Security", "excerpts": ["Immigration and U.S. National Security: The State of Play Since 9/11\n# Immigration and U.S. National Security: The State of Play Since 9/11\nThe wide-ranging reforms that followed the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States significantly strengthened the national security capabilities of immigration agencies. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created to bridge gaps between the intelligence community and immigration functions. Yet, the restructuring was not comprehensive, and threats to national security continue to evolve.

It assesses the tools available to respond to these threats, and the successes and challenges to date in innovating as risks evolve.

Under the Trump administration, resources and political will have also been steered away from core DHS national security missions, including disaster response, cyber security, and general policy and planning in favor of immigration enforcement measures focused on low-risk unauthorized migrants and asylum seekers.

Trump himself blustered that he was going to halt all migration from the \u201cThird World\u201d (a Cold War term generally used to refer to the developing world or Global South), while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called on Trump to issue travel bans on \u201cevery damn country that\u2019s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.\u201d \nBut as is so often the case with this administration, the disgusting and dehumanizing rhetoric both reflects and obscures a radical agenda. Since early last week \u2013 even before the National Guard shooting \u2013 the administration has rolled out a series of policies that call into question the futures of hundreds of thousands of people who have been living legally in the United States for years. \nNot only has the Trump administration put processing on hold for several groups of people and categories of immigration applications and petitions \u2013 including a hold on all asylum approvals, and a hold on all application approvals for anyone from one of the [9 countries covered in the travel ban](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/report/trump-2025-travel-ban/) the administration issued this spring \u2013 but it has opened the door to potentially reopen cases the government has already approved over the last four-and-a-half years; or even further in the past.", "While some details about how these policies will be implemented are still unknown, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has issued policy memos that offer some clarity as to what the administration is actually doing. \nSince the administration\u2019s changes affect different populations for different phases of the immigration process, we\u2019re breaking it down step-by-step. \n## A freeze on all processing \u2013 even for citizenship \u2013 for anyone who comes from a travel-ban country \nAll citizens and/or nationals of one of the 19 countries covered in the most recent \u201ctravel ban\u201d proclamation issued by the Trump administration this summer. \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials have been instructed to freeze processing of all immigration benefits (which includes permanent and temporary status within the U.S.) for these individuals. The suspended benefits processing appears to include everything from applications for green cards and citizenship to applications for work permits and even to applications filed to change or extend a nonimmigrant status \u2014 potentially causing some people to fall out of valid nonimmigrant status if the government refuses to process their request for an extension before it expires. \nThis means that the government will not adjudicate their applications, and in some cases the government has canceled interviews that are a part of the process. Across the country, immigrants from covered countries have reported that their citizenship interviews have been canceled \u2013 and even, in some cases, the ceremonies at which they were set to formally become U.S. citizens.", "_How long it will last:_ The length of this freeze is unknown. The memo claims that the freeze is needed to conduct a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d both of their individual cases, and of the agency\u2019s security and vetting policies. It directs USCIS to issue operational guidance within 90 days \u2013 however, it is not clear whether the application freeze will expire at the end of that time, or whether it will be modified or extended. \nIt is worth noting, though, that even once USCIS adjudicators resume reviews of applications and petitions from travel-ban-covered countries, they will be using much more restrictive criteria for some of them given changes announced to the USCIS policy manual on Thanksgiving. These instruct USCIS employees to consider nationality from a country on the travel ban list as a \u201csignificant negative factor\u201d in determining whether to approve someone\u2019s application or petition. Specifically, manual states that countries such as Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Venezuela are countries where the U.S. cannot trust the government to accurately identify people or security risks, and therefore nationality from those countries may be a \u201csignificant negative factor\u201d in deciding whether to grant a benefit. \n(This is one of a few shifting rationales for the travel ban, even though it has been widely reported that the administration is using the ban as a threat to try to coerce countries into [going along with other parts of Trump\u2019s agenda](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/16/nx-s1-5435369/trump-administration-could-impose-a-travel-ban-on-dozens-more-countries).) That change is only allowed to apply to forms received on or after the effective date (November 27). \n## A pause on decisions \u2013 but not interviews \u2013 for all asylum applications filed with USCIS", "all asylum-seekers who have filed an application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for \u201casylum (in other words, those who applied proactively, instead of applying for asylum as part of proceedings before an immigration judge) who already affected by the travel-ban application freeze. \nLast week, USCIS ordered adjudicators to stop issuing final decisions on asylum applications (approvals, denials, or closures). However, asylum interviews at USCIS are still being scheduled, indicating that processing of applications for people who do not come from one of the 19 travel-ban countries is continuing up to a point. \n_How long it will last:_ Unclear; the asylum decision pause was addressed in the same USCIS memo that directed operational guidance \u201cwithin 90 days.\u201d \n_How big is the impact?_ The Trump administration hadn\u2019t exactly been tearing through asylum decisions before this announcement. As of June of this year, there were over 1.5 million pending asylum applications before USCIS. And while the Trump administration issued about 135,000 decisions between April and June, the overwhelming majority of those were \u201cadministrative closures\u201d \u2014 barely 10,000 people had applications denied or approved during that time. \n## A blanket refusal to issue visas to Afghans \u2013 and destruction of those that have been printed \nAfghan nationals seeking to enter the United States legally on a permanent or temporary visa. \nLast week, consular officials were instructed to refuse all visas to Afghan nationals under section 221(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (a different provision from the travel ban). Furthermore, they were told to destroy visas that had been printed, but had not yet been given to the applicant. \n_How long it will last:_ Unclear.", "_How big is the impact?_ Because Afghanistan was already included in the travel ban, very few visas were being issued to Afghan nationals even before the new guidance. Even before the travel ban took effect, the State Department issued fewer than 1,300 visas to Afghans in the month of May (the last month for which monthly information is available). The overwhelming majority of those were Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who worked with coalition forces, and who were already subject to extensive vetting and years of security screening. \n## A review \u2013 including a potential re-interview \u2013 of applications that have already been approved \nThere are two different policy changes covering two overlapping groups. The first group is all people admitted to the U.S. as refugees under the Biden administration \u2013 about 200,000 in all. The second group includes citizens and nationals of the travel-ban countries who arrived in the U.S. after January 21, 2021 and were granted immigration benefit \u2013 everything from temporary work authorization to green cards. \nThe scale of the review appears to be different for each group. \nFor people from travel ban-covered countries, USCIS identified a few specific security indicators that need to be included in \u201ccase-by-case review,\u201d such as association with suspicious individuals or groups. However, the memo instructs officials to submit a list of cases it wishes to prioritize for \u201creview and potential re-interview\u201d within 90 days, implying that not all cases will be reopened. The memo does not spell out what will happen to people who fail the review."]}]}, {"query": "benefits and challenges of expanding legal immigration in the US", "retrieved_documents": [{"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "599a805e-4aba-5e5a-91fe-4f33d095aa74", "url": "https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/immigration-challenges-implementing-the-one-big-beautiful-bill/", "title": "Immigration Challenges and Concerns in Implementing the ...", "excerpts": ["# Immigration Challenges and Concerns in Implementing the \u2018One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019\n_The American Immigration Council is a non-profit, non-partisan organization.[Sign up to receive our latest analysis as soon as it's published.](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/subscribe/)_\nOn July 4, 2025, President Donald Trump signed H.R. 1, the so-called \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u201d into law. After months of tense intraparty negotiations, Republicans passed the bill through the reconciliation process. This , normally reserved for changes to revenue and spending policy, allows legislation to move forward with a simple majority in the Senate, bypassing the usual 60-vote threshold. The final bill aggressively uses federal funding to pursue sweeping policy goals, particularly around immigration and border enforcement.\nH.R. 1 $170.7 billion toward immigration and border enforcement to spread over about a four-year period ending in September 2029. Averaged annually, this is two-thirds of the discretionary budget for the entire Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Notably, rather than making investments in the broader legal immigration system, the law hikes up fees significantly for a wide range of legal protections and benefits, such as asylum, work permits, and requests for . As implementation begins, there are significant questions about the real-world outcomes of this legislation\u2014and whether the system can absorb and manage such a dramatic expansion.\n## Arrests and Enforcement: Scaling Up Fast, But at What Cost?", "With approximately $28 billion given to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) annually, the agency now has a budget larger than the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), U.S. Marshals Service, and Bureau of Prisons combined. In January, ICE goal to arrest between 1,500 and 2,000 people per day and only recently in late May that artificial quota. Since then, ICE has aimed to arrest as many as 3,000 people per day\u2014a nearly impossible goal before H.R 1. However, since H.R. 1 was signed into law, Tom Homan, a special advisor to President Trump on immigration and border enforcement and a former Acting ICE Director, that number could climb up to 7,000.\nThis is because the new law provides ICE with enough funding to , which DHS believes can help it achieve up to one million deportations per year. Given that the funds must be used within four years, ICE must spend them quickly. Under H.R.1, ICE is prepared to offer large bonuses of $10,000 per agent but recruitment at this scale is logistically difficult, and the administration will have to reduce historical recruitment standards, training quality, and oversight to increase ICE personnel to such a level in the given period.\n## Detention Capacity: Rapid Expansion Amid Signs of Strain and No Oversight\nThe most striking aspect of the new law is its extraordinary investment in detention. H.R. 1 provides $45 billion for the expansion of immigrant detention facilities, including family detention. Averaged annually, this amounts to over $10.6 billion in added detention spending per year, bringing ICE\u2019s annual detention budget to at least $14 billion. That figure is a 311% increase over the agency\u2019s FY 2024 detention budget and is nearly double the entire FY 2025 budget of the Bureau of Prisons. Based on", "ICE has been preparing for this infusion of cash for months, having a request for proposals in April to find facilities it could use to rapidly expand detention. Several private contractors, including GEO Group and CoreCivic, which dominate the private prison industry, have already some of their existing contracts to expand the number of beds for immigration detention and have proposed re-purposing dormant prisons for civil immigration purposes.\nYet even before this expansion begins in earnest, the system is showing . As oversight mechanisms have been gutted, of overcrowding and lack of food have surfaced. Meanwhile, an of data from June by the CATO Institute shows that of the 204,297 individuals booked into detention since the start of FY 2025, 65% had no criminal convictions, and over 93% had no history of violent offenses. Many were detained for immigration violations, traffic offenses, or other low-level infractions. And this year is on track to surpass last year\u2019s record of of people in ICE\u2019s custody.\n## State and Local Involvement: Expanding Federal Immigration Enforcement\nH.R. 1 sets aside at least $14 billion to reimburse immigration enforcement partnerships with state and local governments. Since January, several executive orders have significantly expanded state and local involvement in immigration enforcement. H.R. 1 includes funding to expand the number of active \u2014a program that deputizes local law enforcement to perform federal immigration duties. In a hearing in early May, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem that 6,200 local law enforcement officers had been deputized under the 287(g) program, which effectively doubled the number of ICE\u2019s deportation agents. Since January, the program has increased sixfold\u2014from 135 agreements at the beginning of Trump\u2019s second term to [811 as of July 14](https://www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/287g).", "Similarly, through these partnerships, ICE will expand detention even more quickly. In Florida, for instance, state authorities built the Everglades detention camp in , which currently has the capacity to detain 3,000 people\u2014a model that are looking to follow. However, concerns about such facilities have grown as several legislators have the facility\u2019s inhumane and unsanitary conditions.\n## While Mass Deportations Drive Immigration Policy, Other Challenges Remain\nDespite the bill\u2019s enormous enforcement spending, less than 8% of the $170.7 billion funding will go to support immigration court processing. As of May 2025, the backlog in immigration courts 3.9 million cases. Rather than addressing this through more judges or support staff, H.R. 1 caps the number of immigration judges at 800. This mismatch in funding priorities risks further entrenching delays and arbitrary outcomes.\nIn addition, H.R. 1 imposes sweeping new and mandatory fees on legal immigration processes, making it harder for people to navigate the system lawfully. While the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which oversees the immigration courts, has to charge the new fees, it has a uniform system to do so, resulting in the rejection of some asylum applications. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has not yet imposed the new fees but has its intention to do so soon.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement has also exposed the risks of pursuing mass deportation while sidelining economic and humanitarian realities. In California, ICE raids have triggered labor shortages, with up to abandoning fields out of fear. The administration\u2019s contradictory responses\u2014from Medicaid recipients can replace deported farmworkers to providing a for immigrants in certain industries\u2014fails to meaningfully address the U.S. economy\u2019s structural dependence on immigrant labor in agriculture, construction, healthcare, hospitality, and other critical sectors.", "There are also concerns that H.R. 1\u2019s massive infusion of enforcement-focused funding will further empower ICE to escalate its aggressive tactics, including , , and even the . Compounding these concerns is DHS\u2019s ongoing of federal law enforcement personnel from other agencies\u2014drawing resources away from missions focused on drug enforcement, national security, and other critical priorities. As the implementation of H.R. 1 unfolds, this new era of enforcement risks accelerating the erosion of civil liberties, destabilizing key sectors of the labor force, and undermining the rule of law itself."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "127f57dd-13c5-52c5-92ca-b02131539764", "url": "https://www.fwd.us/news/americans-and-immigration/", "title": "Immigration Benefits All Americans and Strengthens the ...", "excerpts": ["_Research shows that immigration brings numerous benefits to the U.S., strengthening our economy and increasing prosperity for all Americans._\nThe facts are clear: immigrants and immigration are good for America and all Americans.\nImmigration strengthens the U.S. economy and contributes to greater prosperity for all Americans.

Below I review 3 examples of potential evidence-based investments, ranging from social inclusion and meeting basic needs to ensuring supportive neighborhoods.", "On a personal note, I am an immigrant to this country. My family was part of the wave of refugees from the Middle East that I now study in some of my own research. Fleeing civil war, we lived in several Middle Eastern countries\u2014including in the Persian Gulf during the 1991 Gulf War\u2014before moving permanently to the United States in the 1990s. My parents received the Earned Income Tax Credit and food stamps (now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP]). While we have also faced our share of government-sanctioned hardships, the support that my family received in our first years in the United States helped us to thrive, and ultimately enabled me to now conduct research on the same safety-net policies I once received, from a place of privilege in academia.\nResearch in the social sciences suggests that social inclusion of refugees and other vulnerable immigrants has pay-offs for economic and social outcomes as well. These benefits accrue to both the immigrants themselves as well as their broader communities. For example, one study exploited a natural experiment created by a California policy allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, finding that it improved traffic safety, specifically by reducing the number of hit-and-run accidents. Another study in several major US cities found that supporting naturalization of eligible immigrants not only increased their earnings and homeownership rates but also increased tax revenues in their cities of residence and, in most cases, decreased the overall cost of public benefits. This report conducted by the Urban Institute was sponsored by the Office of Immigrant Affairs in New York City, which is among the cities most affected by the current influx of asylum seekers, and where political debates are raging about how far to go in accommodating these newcomers.", "While there is more limited quasi-experimental research on how US policies that support social inclusion of at-risk immigrants influence health, a handful of studies have suggested the potential benefits. For example, studies of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program\u2014a 2012 policy that prevented deportation for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children\u2014have demonstrated that it resulted in improved mental health for both the DACA beneficiaries themselves during adulthood, as well as their own children."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "0ac1ac56-8dc1-59c4-883b-bdf497740fcc", "url": "https://clacs.berkeley.edu/migration-economic-benefits-immigration", "title": "MIGRATION: The Economic Benefits of Immigration", "excerpts": ["# MIGRATION: The Economic Benefits of Immigration\n## By Giovanni Peri | [Berkeley Review of Latin American Studies, Fall 2013](https://clacs.berkeley.edu/publications/berkeley-review-latin-american-studies/fall-2013)\n[Download the PDF of this article](https://clacs.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/publications/brlasfall2013-peri.pdf) \u00b7 More on this event\nImmigration has always been a formidable engine of economic and demographic growth for the United States. During the last decades of the 19 century, immigrants contributed substantially, providing labor for the industrialization and electrification of the country. That wave of immigration was ended by the very restrictive immigration laws passed in 1929. While the \u201cImmigration and Nationality Act\u201d of 1965 abolished national quotas and allowed the flow of immigrants to resume, it has only been during the last 30 years that the mobility of the world\u2019s people has increased significantly. Young, motivated, and often highly educated people are on the move, and many of them would like to come to the United States. With its 41 million immigrants, the United States is by far the largest magnet for international migrants. Moreover, according to Gallup World Polls, there are about 150 million more people who say that they would migrate to the United States (from every country on the planet) if they had the opportunity.", "While immigration flows, if managed efficiently and flexibly, would bring strong opportunities for economic growth, U.S. immigration laws remain outdated, cumbersome, and rather restrictive. These laws have substantially limited immigration for work-related reasons, both among the highly educated (scientists and engineers) and the less educated (construction, agricultural, and personal service workers). The misalignment between restrictive laws and economic incentives has also caused the population of undocumented immigrants to expand rapidly. Attracted by employment, but unable to secure a legal permit, 11 million people work and have set down roots in the United States, despite great uncertainty and little protection.\nOn June 27, 2013, the U.S. Senate seemed set to change all that, by passing Senate Bill 744, the \u201cBorder Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act.\u201d The bill is the result of compromise, and is therefore imperfect. Still, it could become the most important piece of legislation on immigration of the last 50 years. It addresses most of the relevant issues plaguing the U.S. immigration system and deals with the problem of undocumented immigrants. As of today, however, due to political polarization, it seems unlikely that the House will pass the bill, despite its potential benefits for the U.S. economy.\n### Who Migrates to the U.S. for Economic Reasons?", "Abundant research, based on comprehensive data on net migration to rich countries, has shown that two groups have a much higher propensity to migrate internationally. The first group consists of the highly educated, in particular, college-educated individuals. They have emigration rates four to five times higher than workers with no college education, and in poor countries, they are 10 to 12 times more likely to migrate. The second group is made up of the young: individuals between 20 and 40 years of age have the highest propensity to migrate. After 45, few people choose to leave their home countries.\nLooking at the United States, a very large group of immigrants (as a percentage of the native population with similar skills) is made up of young, highly educated workers, mainly scientists and engineers. Another large group consists of young workers with little education who are employed in highly manual-intensive occupations. Figure 1 shows that ordering schooling levels from low to high and reporting the percentage of foreign-born workers for each skill group reveals a clear, U-shaped distribution. The percentage of foreign-born workers, as of 2011, was very high among workers with no degree, mainly employed in manual-intensive jobs. It was also very high among highly educated science, technology, engineering, and math workers (STEM). The percentage of foreign-born workers was much smaller for intermediate levels of education. The group of immigrants with very little education included a large part of the undocumented workers. This was due, in part, to the fact that there are very few legal ways for foreign workers with low schooling levels to enter the United States, despite there being significant demand for them. The current composition of U.S. immigrants follows the labor market logic. Adapting immigration laws to reflect this logic, as the proposed reform would do, makes perfect sense and would improve efficiency.\n### The Economic Effects of Immigrants", "The very simple logic of demand and supply implies that, other thing being fixed, an increase in the labor supply reduces wages as workers compete in an increasingly crowded economy. While correct on its face, this is \u201cpartial equilibrium\u201d reasoning. Since partial equilibrium models rely on the assumption that other things are kept fixed, they do not account for the series of adjustments and responses of the economy to immigration. Still, that simple logic is often pushed to its Malthusian implication that more workers in an economy mean lower wages and lower incomes. These partial equilibrium implications are likely to be incorrect, theoretically and empirically, in \u201cgeneral equilibrium.\u201d The workings of four important mechanisms attenuate \u2014 and often reverse \u2014 the partial effects of an increased supply of foreign workers on the demand for native workers.\nFirst, as a consequence of the availability of more workers, firms invest: they expand their productive capacity and build more establishments. The productive capacity (capital) per worker has grown in the U.S. economy at a constant rate during the period from 1960 to 2009. If anything, capital per worker was higher when immigration was at its peak in 2007 than it was in 1990 before the immigration boom began. Investments, that is, were responsive to the predictable inflows of workers. Hence, immigrants did not crowd out existing firms over the long run. Rather, they increased the size and number of firms providing investment opportunities.", "Second, workers are not all the same. In terms of their labor market skills, there is a large difference between workers with tertiary education and those with a secondary education or less. It makes sense to distinguish between these two groups because they do different jobs. A modified version of the wage-depressing effect of immigrants is that, if the relative supply of less-educated workers among the foreign-born is larger, their inflow would depress the wages of less-educated natives relative to highly educated natives. In the U.S., however, because of the combination of immigrants at the top and the bottom of the schooling distribution (as seen in the chart on the next page), immigrants have had a balanced distribution. The overall proportion of college-educated immigrants has been very similar to that of natives. So, their inflow did not significantly alter the relative supply of those two broad groups. Labor economists consider the split between the tertiary and non-tertiary educated as the most relevant factor for understanding the effects of relative supply on relative wages.\nSince immigration did not alter the relative supply of these two groups, it is unlikely to have changed their relative wages. At the national level, immigration cannot explain the observed increase in the relative wage of college-educated workers versus high-school graduates observed in the 1980s and 1990s, simply because it did not much affect that relative supply.\n### Specialization and Technology: Job Upgrades"]}]}, {"query": "immigration vetting processes and fraud prevention", "retrieved_documents": [{"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "4eaf8213-0eb4-5dff-ab80-0396816c648e", "url": "https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/us-citizenship-and-immigration-services-establishes-new-center-to-strengthen-immigration-screening", "title": "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Establishes ...", "excerpts": ["#  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Establishes New Center to Strengthen Immigration Screening and Target Bad Actors  \n_New vetting center will focus on powerful screening resources to keep America safe_\nToday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced the establishment of a specialized unit to strengthen the ability of America\u2019s immigration system to screen out terrorists, criminal aliens, and other foreign nationals who pose potential threats to public safety or who have committed fraud or other crimes.

EAD Validity Periods Reduced to Increase Vetting Frequency\nLast week, USCIS announced that the maximum validity period for numerous categories of Employment Authorization Documents\u2014refugees, asylees, TPS applicants, adjustment applicants, and others\u2014will be reduced from five years back to 18 months or less.\nAccording to USCIS, the purpose is simple: more renewals mean more opportunities to recheck backgrounds, detect fraud, and review eligibility under updated security standards.\n  * More pressure for filings to be complete, consistent, and error-free", "Even for long-time applicants with strong histories in the United States, the threshold for scrutiny is rising.\n## 2. In November, USCIS Also Ended Automatic EAD Extensions \u2014 Another Move Toward More Screening\nThis latest development builds on an important policy shift from just a few weeks earlier.\nIn late October, USCIS ended the long-standing policy of automatic EAD extensions for most renewal applicants. Under the previous rules, many workers could continue employment for up to 540 days while their renewal was pending. As of October 30, 2025, that grace period is gone for most categories. As we explained in our , this change is part of the same overarching trend: USCIS and DHS want more frequent, hands-on vetting before granting ongoing work authorization.\nEach of these policy shifts\u2014shorter EAD validity and the elimination of automatic extensions\u2014pushes applicants into more renewal cycles and, therefore, more rounds of security screening. The message is consistent and unmistakable: continued authorization to work in the United States can no longer rely on passive extensions or long-duration cards.\n## 3. USCIS Pauses All Adjudications for Nationals of 19 Countries Following the D.C. Shooting\nThe tightening of security reviews is not limited to work authorization. According to internal guidance obtained by CBS News, USCIS has temporarily halted the final adjudication of immigration cases\u2014including naturalization ceremonies\u2014for nationals of 19 countries designated under the administration\u2019s updated travel-ban proclamation.\nThis pause follows the tragic shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. While the policy\u2019s scope and duration are still evolving, the underlying principle is consistent with the EAD changes: USCIS is reevaluating prior vetting and applying enhanced security scrutiny to entire groups of applicants regardless of their individual history in the U.S. and the benefits for which they are applying.", "The broader takeaway is not about the specifics of these 19 countries. It is that:\n  * USCIS can pause or slow adjudications system-wide in response to national security concerns as they arise\n  * Even routine filings\u2014green cards, naturalization, adjustment, work permits\u2014can be swept into these broader reviews\n  * Applicants should expect interviews, requests for evidence, and layers of verification in the months ahead", "## A Larger Pattern Is Emerging\nAcross all of these developments, a unifying theme is clear: USCIS is shifting toward a \u201ccontinuous vetting\u201d model. Not just at the initial filing stage. Not just for high-risk categories. Not just after an isolated security incident. Across the entire system. This means:\n  * More scrutiny of past approvals\n  * More detailed verification of employers, job duties, credentials, and identities\n\nIn short: Immigration filings once viewed as routine now require strategic planning and meticulous documentation.\n## Why This Matters for Applicants and Employers\nThese policy shifts carry real practical consequences:\n### 1. Delays are more likely.\nMore touchpoints mean more opportunities for cases to stall.\n### 2. Small errors may now trigger bigger consequences.\nA typo or gap in documentation that USCIS might have overlooked before may now lead to requests for evidence\u2014or worse, denials.\n### 3. Long-term strategies are now essential.\nDependents, concurrent filings, status overlaps, and employer compliance must be carefully coordinated.\n### 4. Proactive legal guidance is no longer optional.\nIn the past, EAD renewals and certain benefit requests were treated as \u201crubber stamp\u201d processes. That era is over.\nWhile the environment is tightening, there is good news: Applicants who prepare early, document thoroughly, and anticipate security review are well-positioned to succeed.\nAt Buda Law Group, we have already updated our internal procedures to reflect:\n  * The end of automatic extensions\n  * Heightened vetting for employment-based and humanitarian filings\n  * The potential impact of country-specific adjudication pauses", "We help clients build RFE-resistant, audit-ready cases that withstand these new scrutiny levels and move forward as smoothly as possible.\n## Need Guidance Navigating the New Vetting Landscape?

USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow cited several recent violent incidents involving foreign nationals as a key reason for accelerating the creation of the vetting center.\n_\u201cThis new vetting center will give us more enhanced capabilities to safeguard national security and ensure public safety,\u201d_ Edlow said, emphasizing the need for stronger screening measures amid changing security threats.\nThe center is designed to serve as a centralized hub for advanced background checks, allowing USCIS to more quickly adapt to new risks while applying consistent across immigration applications.\n## A Shift in Immigration Enforcement Priorities\nUSCIS leadership also framed the move as a policy shift from the previous administration. Edlow stated that under the Biden administration, the agency was pressured to speed up immigration and processing, often at the expense of national security considerations.\n_\u201cWe changed that approach on day one of the Trump administration,\u201d_ Edlow said. _\u201cUnder President Trump, we are building more protective measures that ensure fraud, deception, and threats do not breach the integrity of our immigration system.\u201d_\nThis announcement signals a broader tightening of immigration screening policies as part of the administration\u2019s national security agenda.\n## How the Vetting Center Will Operate\nOnce fully operational, the USCIS Vetting Center will:", "* Conduct enhanced, supplemental reviews of immigration applications and petitions\n  * Use both classified and non-classified intelligence resources\n  * Leverage state-of-the-art technology, including artificial intelligence\n  * Access Department of Homeland Security, law enforcement, and intelligence community databases\n  * Review both pending and previously approved applications\n  * Prioritize applications from presidentially designated", "This holistic review process significantly expands USCIS\u2019s ability to reassess immigration benefits even after approval, a shift that could have wide-ranging consequences for applicants.\n## Part of a Broader National Security Strategy\nThe new vetting center is one piece of a larger set of actions tied to Executive Order 14161, titled _Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats_. Other recent developments include:\n  * Allowing officers to consider negative country-specific factors, such as lack of reliable identity documents or weak criminal background check systems\n  * A pause on affirmative asylum application decisions\n  * Record-level hiring of new USCIS personnel focused on national security\n  * A proposed rule to increase screening before extending work authorization\n  * The creation of USCIS special agents with law enforcement powers to investigate and prosecute immigration violations\n\nTogether, these measures represent one of the most sweeping expansions of immigration enforcement and vetting authority in recent years.\n## What This Means for Immigrants and Applicants\nFor immigrants and visa applicants, the new vetting center could mean:\n  * Longer for some cases due to deeper background reviews\n  * Increased scrutiny for applicants from high-risk or designated countries\n  * Greater focus on identifying fraud, misrepresentation, and security concerns\n  * The possibility of reopened or re-reviewed previously approved cases", "While USCIS maintains that these changes are aimed at protecting public safety, the expanded authority also raises concerns among advocates about due process, transparency, and potential delays for legitimate applicants.\n## Need Help With Your Immigration Case?\nWith USCIS expanding its screening and vetting powers, immigration applications are facing more scrutiny than ever.

Where there once was a broad consensus across political affiliations that immigration overall was a positive force for the United States, today that sentiment no longer holds for significant swaths of the American public. A Gallup poll in July showed that 55 percent of Americans want to [see lower levels of immigration](https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx)\u2014the highest such result since 2001 and up from 41 percent just a year earlier. At the same time, proponents of immigration can point to influential Congressional Budget Office estimates showing that increased immigration expected over the 2021-2026 period will [drive economic growth and contribute to reduced federal deficits](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60165) and inflation over the next decade. Yet the arrival of large numbers of newcomers has also strained public services in communities across the United States.\nFears of uncontrolled migration and arguments about its perceived costs bear an uncanny resemblance to the nativist backlash of the late 1910s and early 1920s, which were a response to high immigration flows. The restrictive National Origins Quotas Acts of 1921 and 1924 reshaped U.S. migration flows for nearly half a century. Whether the United States will head down an immigration-narrowing path again will owe in large measure to power brokers at the White House and in a Congress that has failed to significantly update the legal immigration system since 1990.", "Yet one large\u2014but often underappreciated\u2014difference between the United States a century ago and today is the country's shifting demographics. Over the past few decades, U.S. birthrates have declined as lifespans have lengthened, a phenomenon also seen in other advanced industrialized societies. The old-age dependency ratio\u2014the proportion of the senior population (65 and over) relative to the working-age cohort (18-64)\u2014was 29 percent in 2023, up from 20 percent in 2000. This share is to 37 percent by 2040. In stark contrast, the old-age dependency ratio stood at just 8 percent in 1920. In plain terms: While there may be a rhetorical similarity between now and a century ago, the reality is that the stakes are greater today in terms of immigration levels because of intensifying pressure on a smaller number of workers to support a growing number of retirees.\nconsists of two groups:\n1) immigrants (i.e., the first generation) are persons who were not U.S. citizens at birth. Immigrants include naturalized U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents (also called green-card holders), refugees and asylees, certain legal nonimmigrants (including those on student, work, or other temporary visas), and persons residing in the country without authorization.\n2) U.S.-born individuals with one or more immigrant parents (i.e., the second generation).\n_U.S.-born individuals with both U.S.-born parents_ (i.e., the third-and-higher generation) consists of persons born in the United States to parents who are U.S. born.", "How does immigration address these worrying demographic trends? Because most immigrants arrive when they are younger, they expand the pool of new workers and lower the age-dependency ratio in the immediate term. Importantly, the country also benefits from immigration in the longer term when the U.S.-born children of immigrants\u2014the second generation\u2014join the workforce. In 2023, immigrants and their U.S.-born children accounted for nearly 91 million people, or 27 percent of the total civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population\u2014up from 20 percent in 2000 (see Box 1 for definitions of immigrant generation).\nIn the new analysis detailed here, Migration Policy Institute (MPI) researchers provide first-ever projections of the U.S. working-age population by immigrant generation, building on the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s recent population projections by nativity. The results shed light on future population trends and their implications for the size of the U.S. working-age population by 2040. The results underscore the large and often overlooked impact of the growing working-age population of the U.S.-born offspring of immigrants in offsetting the declines in U.S. workers brought about by aging and lower fertility rates.\n## Modeling Changes to the Future Working-Age Population Based on Various Immigration Scenarios", "The Census Bureau developed that assume differing levels of net international migration (the difference between the number of both foreign and U.S.-born individuals arriving and leaving the United States per year). The total number of working-age immigrant adults in the United States will vary greatly depending on the direction of future immigration policy (see data tool). The number of working-age immigrants, which stood at 35.4 million in 2020, would change by 2040 as follows under the four scenarios: Zero immigration (sharp drop to 18.5 million), low immigration, as seen during the latter Trump administration (31 million), current immigration (37.3 million), and high immigration (46.7 million).\nData Tool.

That included more than 3 million in 2023 alone, the largest annual total ever recorded, according to a Center analysis of government data sources.\nAlongside this increase, immigrants\u2019 origin regions have also shifted, with a growing share coming from South America and Europe and a declining share coming from Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\nBetween 2021 and 2023, 20% of newly arrived immigrants were from South America, up from 13% in the period between 2015 and 2019. Another 12% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 were from Europe or Canada, up from 9% in the earlier period.\nAt the same time, 24% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 were from South and East Asia, down from 29% in 2015-19. And 5% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 involved people from sub-Saharan Africa, down from 8% in 2015-19.\nMexico was the largest origin country for immigrants who arrived between 2021 and 2023. About 11% of immigrants who came to the U.S. during this period were born in Mexico. Rounding out the top five countries of origin for immigrants who arrived during this period were India (8%), Venezuela (7%), Cuba (6%) and Colombia (5%).\nThroughout this period, unauthorized immigrants accounted for most new immigrant arrivals, with many coming from Central and South America."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "3d484a81-876a-5a6e-88c3-d7864714365c", "url": "https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/how-is-immigration-shaping-us-cities/", "title": "How Immigration is Shaping US Cities", "excerpts": ["# How Immigration is Shaping US Cities\n_The American Immigration Council is a non-profit, non-partisan organization.[Sign up to receive our latest analysis as soon as it's published.](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/subscribe/)_\nImmigrants have long been key to population growth in the United States. Between 2018 and 2023, they were responsible for 42.1% of population growth in America\u2019s 100 largest metro areas. In particular, 91.7% of population growth in , 83.7% in , 82.1% in , and 76.9% in was attributable to increase in their immigrant population.\nIn these 100 largest metro areas, at least 1 in every 6 residents was an immigrant in 2023, according to the newly released data from the American Immigration Council\u2019s . These figures highlight the vital role immigrants play in reshaping metro areas across the country by sustaining the workforce in key industries, and powering technological innovation. While much of the increases are concentrated in these hubs, the benefits of their growth extend far beyond the metro regions.\n## Population Trends in U.S. Metro Areas\nImmigrants are a stabilizing force in areas with shrinking populations. About one-fifth of the top 100 metro areas saw their U.S.-born population decline between 2018 to 2023. Among these metro areas, 85% experienced growth in their immigrant population.\nIn some metro areas, immigrants fully offset population decline. For example, without the 19.4% increase in the immigrant population between 2018 and 2023, Baltimore would have suffered a total population loss of 0.9%.\nMetro Areas Where Immigrants Reversed Population Decline Between 2018 and 2023\nPercent Change in Immigrant Population | Percent Change in Total Population | Percent Change in Total Population Without Growth in Immigrant Population  \n---|---|---", "The metro areas with the highest growth rates of their immigrant population\u2014over 35% increase during this five-year period\u2014were Lakeland, FL (57.6%); Baton Rouge, LA (41.7%); Knoxville, TN (38.8%); Raleigh, NC (38.6%); and Indianapolis, IN (37.8%), which all had smaller than average immigrant populations in 2018.\nIn 2023, a total of 76.9% of immigrants were of working age (16-64), compared to 61.4% of U.S.-born residents. The number of Americans over the age of 65 [is expected to reach 80 million](https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/program-retirement-policy/projects/data-warehouse/what-future-holds/us-population-aging) by 2040. Immigrants not only fill job openings left by U.S.-born workers retiring from the labor force, but they are also overrepresented in roles that are critical to caring for an aging population.\nWhile there is projected to be a shortage of across metropolitan areas in the United States by 2037, immigrants are already playing a disproportionate role in filling these gaps. Immigrants made up 20.7% of nurses working in the country\u2019s 100 largest metros areas in 2023. In some metro areas, this share was even higher with immigrants making up more than one in three nurses. At least half of all health aides in the Miami, San Jose, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C., and Seattle metro areas were immigrants.\nAcross the 100 largest metro areas, immigrants consistently show high levels of labor force participation. Immigrants made up 22% of the labor force in the top 100 metro areas in 2023\u2014higher than their 18.1% share of the population. Their employment rate was 96.1%.", "Immigrant-led households contributed over $577.4 billion in taxes in 2023, including $373.1 billion in federal and $204.3 billion in state and local taxes, leaving them with $1.5 trillion in spending power\u2014money that could be spent on local businesses and services. These figures underscore the essential role immigrants play\u2014not just as workers, but as taxpayers and consumers who help sustain local economies.\nImmigrants\u2019 economic impact also extends into entrepreneurship. In 2023, 29.8% of business owners in the top 100 metro areas were immigrants, generating $98.2 billion in business income. In the McAllen, Texas; Miami; and San Jose metro areas, over half of all business owners were immigrants.\nImmigrants also play an outsized role in maintaining the United States\u2019 role as a center for innovation and technological breakthrough. Nationally, [23.6% of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) workers](https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/national/) were immigrants. In the cities known for being centers for technological innovation, this share was even higher, with 67.4% of STEM workers being immigrants in San Jose and 49.7% in San Francisco.\nImmigrants\u2019 impact varies by region, shaped by local industries, demographics, and policy environments. But one trend is clear: immigrants are increasingly vital to U.S. metro areas.

These population changes are likely to have a positive impact on entitlement finances and tax burdens relative to current policy. In contrast, decreasing annual net legal immigration likely has the opposite effects. \nIn 2017, immigrants were about of the U.S. population. So, it is not surprising that changing immigration policy has a notable impact on U.S. demographic trends. In this post, we project the impact of increasing and decreasing annual net legal on the age distribution and education level of the U.S. population. Specifically, we project demographics under current policy relative to policies which decrease annual net legal immigration by 50 percent and increase annual net legal immigration by both 50 percent and 100 percent.\nUnder current policy, we project that the U.S. population continues to increase over the next few decades, although at a declining rate. Figure 1 below shows the population growth path under current policy and under policies that increase and decrease annual net legal immigration.\nFigure 1: U.S. Population Under Current Policy and Three Options for Annual Net Legal Immigration Policy, 2018-2048 (millions of people) \nFigure 2 shows the growth of as a share of the U.S. population. We project that under current policy, this share continues to grow, by an average of 0.76 percent annually between 2018 and 2048. This growth occurs even with no change to policy because new immigrants are younger than native-born Americans. Thus, we expect immigrants have more years to live. Intuitively, increasing/decreasing the annual net flow of immigrants increases/decreases the fraction of the U.S. population that is foreign born.", "Figure 2: Foreign-Born Percent of U.S. Population Under Current Policy and Three Options for Annual Net Legal Immigration Policy, 2018-2048 \nIncreasing or decreasing annual net legal immigration affects the educational attainment of the U.S. population. Of legal immigrants who arrived since 2014, about half held a bachelor\u2019s or advanced degree, compared to a third of native-born Americans.\nIn fact, recent immigrants are better-educated than ever before. We showed that in recent years, immigrants arrive to the U.S. from different countries than in the past. These new arrivals are more likely to immigrate from Asia compared to prior immigrants who were more likely to immigrate from Mexico or Central America. We project that the share of immigrants arriving by country is the same in future years as it is now. We also examined how these trends increased the educational attainment of recent immigrants.\nTherefore, increasing or decreasing annual net legal immigration changes the composition of the immigrant \nFigure 3 shows that the share of the U.S. population with a bachelor\u2019s or advanced degree increases under current Policies that increase annual net legal immigration lead to faster growth in educational attainment because immigrants are more likely to have a bachelor\u2019s or advanced degree.\nFigure 3: Percent of Age 25+ Population Holding a Bachelor's Degree Under Current Policy and Three Options for Annual Net Legal Immigration Policy, 2018-2048 \nNewly arrived immigrants are generally of working age. Thus, the rate of immigration also affects the age distribution of the population, including the old-age dependency and the child dependency", "As can be seen in Figure 4, increasing the rate of immigration increases the working age population relative to the retired age population because immigrants are younger than native-born citizens. Under current policy, in 2048, the old-age dependency ratio is 38 percent. If legal immigration is doubled, then, in 2048, this ratio is 35 percent. If legal immigration is halved, then, in 2048, this ratio is 40 percent.\nFigure 4: U.S. Old-Age Dependency Ratio Under Current Policy and Three Options for Annual Net Legal Immigration Policy, 2018-2048 \nPolicies that lower the old-age dependency ratio, such as increasing legal immigration, are likely to improve federal finances which positively impacts private capital formation and economic growth. Pay-as-you-go old-age entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare accounted for about 45 of non-interest federal spending in 2018. Increasing/decreasing net legal immigration improves/worsens the finances of these programs because it increases the working-age population. Furthermore, qualifying for full benefits takes many years. In addition, while immigrants help pay for other federal spending, such as for defense, they do not generate additional significant costs for the military. Thus, immigrants somewhat reduce the federal tax burden of the average native-born American.", "Figure 5 shows that legal immigrant flows have the opposite effect on the child dependency ratio because immigrants tend to have higher fertility rates than native-born Americans. Nonetheless, increasing the population of children leads to larger workforces in the future. In turn, a larger working-age population provides long-term reductions to the old-age dependency ratio. At the same time, increasing the population of children creates short-term costs, especially on state and local governments, to provide K-12 education and other programs. In the long run, however, this fiscal burden may be offset once the children of immigrants become taxpayers.\nFigure 5: U.S. Child-Age Dependency Ratio Under Current Policy and Three Options for Annual Net Legal Immigration Policy, 2018-2048 \n  1.

At the same time, a record-high 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a good thing for the country.\nThese shifts reverse a four-year trend of rising concern about immigration that began in 2021 and reflect changes among all major party groups.\nWith illegal border crossings down sharply this year, fewer Americans than in June 2024 back hard-line border enforcement measures, while more favor offering pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in the U.S.\nThese findings are based on a June 2-26 Gallup poll of 1,402 U.S. adults, including oversamples of Hispanic and Black Americans, weighted to match national demographics.\nThe same poll finds many more Americans disapproving than approving of President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of immigration. Trump\u2019s 21% approval rating on the issue among Hispanic adults is below his 35% rating nationally, with the deficit likely reflecting that group\u2019s low support for some of the administration\u2019s signature immigration policies.\n## Fewer Americans Want Immigration Decreased\nAfter climbing to 55% in 2024, the percentage of Americans who say immigration should be reduced has dropped by nearly half to 30%. Sentiment is thus back to the level measured in 2021, before the desire for less immigration started to mount. Meanwhile, 38% now want immigration kept at its current level, and 26% say it should be increased.\nWith illegal immigration levels down dramatically and refugee programs suspended, the desire for less immigration has fallen among all party groups, but it is most pronounced among Republicans, down 40 percentage points over the past year to 48%. Among independents, this sentiment is down 21 points to 30%, and among Democrats, down 12 points to 16%.", "Republicans are the only group still showing at least plurality support for reducing immigration. Independents are most likely to favor maintaining current levels, while a plurality of Democrats favor increasing it.\n## Record High Say Immigration Benefits Nation\nWhen asked if immigration is generally a good thing or bad thing for the country, a record-high 79% of U.S. adults call it a good thing; a record-low 17% see it as a bad thing.\nThis is consistent with the long-term pattern of more Americans viewing immigration as helpful than harmful to the country. But today\u2019s endorsement is up from 64% last year and represents a reversal of the downward trend seen in this view from 2021 to 2024.\nThe recent jump in perceptions of immigration being a good thing is largely owed to a sharp increase among Republicans and, to a lesser extent, independents. These groups\u2019 views have essentially rebounded to 2020 levels after souring in the intervening years.\nDemocrats\u2019 belief that immigration is beneficial to the country is also up slightly, to a record-high 91%. However, this is generally consistent with their highly positive perspective on immigration over the past decade, with at least 80% calling it a good thing each year since 2016.\nIn addition to supporting increased or stable immigration levels, more Americans now favor offering undocumented immigrants pathways to citizenship, while fewer support stringent measures to deter or reverse illegal immigration.\nIn terms of impeding illegal immigration at the source, support for increasing the number of Border Patrol agents has declined 17 points to 59%, from 76% a year ago. And backing for expanding the U.S.-Mexico border wall has dropped eight points to 45%. This likely reflects people perceiving these measures as less necessary given the sharp drop in illegal border crossings.", "Yet, support is also lower today for deporting all undocumented immigrants, with 38% now favoring this as the administration is attempting it, down from 47% last year when it was a Trump campaign promise. However, it should be noted that last year\u2019s support for deportation was uniquely high. Today\u2019s level matches where it stood in 2019 (at 37%) and is slightly higher than when first measured in 2016 (32%).\nIn terms of a new policy being debated this year, Americans give lukewarm support to denying alleged gang members the ability to challenge deportation in court \u2014 half favor this being done, while 45% oppose it.\nMeanwhile, support for allowing undocumented immigrants to become U.S. citizens has risen to 78%, up from 70% last year. This is also back to the level of support seen in 2019 (81%) while slightly lower than in 2016 (84%). Approval is higher still, albeit statistically unchanged, for offering individuals brought to the U.S. illegally as children a pathway to citizenship, with support holding above 80%.\nThe declines in support for hiring more border agents and deporting all undocumented immigrants are mainly due to less support from independents and Democrats. Independents are also primarily responsible for the slip in support for expanding the construction of walls along the U.S.-Mexico border. Republicans\u2019 support for each of these measures remains high.\nMeanwhile, the eight-point increase in support for giving immigrants living in the U.S. illegally the chance to become U.S. citizens reflects increased support from all party groups, with the biggest gain among Republicans (up 13 points to 59%).\n## Majority Disapprove of Trump\u2019s Handling of Immigration", "Perhaps because of Americans\u2019 opposition to immigration policies that Trump has enacted to remove undocumented immigrants from the U.S., their evaluation of his work on immigration is mostly negative. Thirty-five percent approve of his handling of the issue, including 21% strongly approving, while 62% disapprove, including 45% strongly.\nThese views are sharply partisan: 85% of Republicans approve of Trump\u2019s handling of immigration, compared with 28% of independents and just 2% of Democrats. Notably, 81% of Democrats strongly disapprove, while 59% of Republicans strongly approve. Independents are much more likely to strongly disapprove (45%) than to strongly approve (14%).\n## Hispanic Adults More Supportive of Citizenship, Less of Enforcement\nHispanic Americans\u2019 views on immigration are particularly relevant to these measures, given the strong focus of current immigration policy on immigrants from parts of Latin America who have entered the U.S. illegally at the southern border.\nIn terms of policy views, the greatest divergence between Hispanic adults and U.S. adults overall is Hispanic adults\u2019 16-point lower support for hiring more border agents (43%). Hispanic adults also trail the general population in their support for deporting all immigrants living in the U.S. illegally (by 15 points, at 23%). They are 13 points likely to support allowing immigrants living in the U.S. to become citizens \u2014 91% favor this.\nAdditionally, at 21%, Hispanic Americans\u2019 approval of Trump\u2019s handling of immigration is 14 points below the national average. With respect to immigration levels, Hispanic adults are slightly more likely than U.S. adults overall to say immigration should be decreased (39% vs. 30%, respectively) as well as to consider immigration a bad thing (25% vs. 17%), but the majority in both cases still express pro-immigration views."]}]}, {"query": "economic and social effects of immigration on U.S. communities", "retrieved_documents": [{"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "de25b448-82b6-530e-a86f-7e42827180c7", "url": "https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/explainer-immigrants-and-us-economy", "title": "Explainer: Immigrants and the U.S. Economy", "excerpts": ["Explainer: Immigrants and the U.S. Economy\n# Explainer: Immigrants and the U.S. Economy\nThe question of whether immigration represents a net cost or a net benefit to the U.S. economy has been a major source of contention, even as the research literature and thinking among economists has been quite clear. Sifting through the full economic and fiscal impacts of immigration is a complex task, but a and consensus by most economists finds that immigration, on balance, is a net positive for the U.S. economy. Still, the public debate over economic impacts continues, as some observers highlight immigrants\u2019 tax payments and labor force contributions, while others underscore education, health care, and other costs to governments.\n## Overall Economic Growth and Impacts\nImmigrants boost overall economic growth by expanding the labor force and increasing consumer spending.The foreign born also start new businesses at higher rates than U.S.-born individuals. Immigrants were involved in the development of in strategic industries in recent years, and [more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/new-american-fortune-500-2024) were founded by immigrants.\nHigher-than-expected immigration [is driving job growth and productivity](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2024/0702) and is projected to continue doing so in the coming years: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the greater level of immigration expected between 2024 and 2034 will [boost gross domestic product (GDP) by $8.9 trillion](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-07/60165-Immigration.pdf).\n## Fiscal Impacts: Do Immigrants Contribute More to Governments than They Cost?", "While immigrants\u2014like U.S.-born individuals\u2014cost governments money for services such as public education, health care, basic infrastructure such as sewer systems and roads, and sometimes public benefits, they also pay into government budgets through sales taxes; property taxes (either directly as homeowners or indirectly through rent payments); and through payroll deductions, taxes on income as well as for Medicare and Social Security. Even unauthorized immigrants who lack work authorization pay these taxes: on top of sales and property taxes, many work on the books using a fake Social Security number or one belonging to another worker, and as a result pay payroll taxes.\nOn balance, do these payments exceed the government spending that immigrants receive? At the federal level, immigrants pay more in taxes over time than they use in government services and benefits, according to a [landmark report by the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2016/09/new-report-assesses-the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration) and a range of . The picture is different at the state and local level. Immigrants tend to cost local governments more than they pay in, primarily due to the cost of their children\u2019s public schooling.", "Immigration has been the major driving force behind U.S. labor force growth over the past 20 years, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Between 2000 and 2022, the foreign born accounted for nearly three-quarters of all growth in the civilian, prime-age (age 25 to 54) labor force. As the U.S. population ages and more U.S.-born residents enter retirement, immigration will become increasingly important for driving labor force growth. Due to population aging, the number of U.S.-born people of prime working age (age 25-54) hardly changed between 2000 and 2022. In contrast, the number of foreign-born people of prime working age grew by almost 7 million over this period. And the U.S.-born senior population (age 65 and older) grew by almost 18 million over the same timeframe.\nThis trend will only accelerate in the future. By , all U.S. population growth will come from international migration starting in 2040.\nEfforts to boost fertility, as an alternative to immigration, are unlikely to be sufficient. Around the world, government efforts to raise fertility through economic incentives or family-friendly policies have a .\n## Do Immigrants Take Jobs from U.S. Workers?\nWhile immigration skeptics have charged that immigrants take jobs from the U.S. born, in particular Black workers, the evidence demonstrates that immigrants [have taken a larger slice of a growing jobs pie](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/beyond-black-jobs-controversy) over recent decades rather than displacing American workers.\nThe number of U.S. jobs is not fixed: In addition to filling jobs, immigrants also foster job growth by consuming goods and services and by starting businesses.", "Further, when employers hire immigrants, they often do so to fill critical positions that enable them to expand operations and , including U.S.-born workers. For example, if a chip manufacturer is able to hire more highly specialized computer scientists from abroad, they can expand overall operations and hire more U.S.-born workers to fill technician, sales, accounting, and other roles.\nBecause immigrants are more likely to appear both at the higher and lower ends of the educational spectrum than the U.S. born, they often fill jobs that complement those held by U.S.-born workers. Some immigrants have skills that most U.S. workers lack (specialized engineering skills, for example), while others fill jobs that are not attractive to U.S. workers because of the wages or working conditions (for example, in agriculture or roofing).\nThe U.S. workers who face the most direct competition from immigrants are those without high school diplomas, including other immigrants who came earlier. Those workers are most likely to see their wages lowered by immigration. But these wage effects are small, with that immigration results in wage declines of just a few percentage points or no wage effects at all.\nWhile the costs of immigration to local governments and to less-educated U.S. workers should not be discounted, immigrants on balance are net contributors to the U.S. economy when considering their contributions to the labor market, to overall economic growth, and to government coffers.\n  * National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, [The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration, 2017](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration).\n  * Congressional Budget Office, [Effects of the Immigration Surge on the Federal Budget and the Economy](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60569), April 2024.", "* Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, [Unprecedented U.S. Immigration Surge Boosts Job Growth, Output](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2024/0702), July 2024.\n  * magazine, [Immigration Is Powering the U.S. Economy](https://time.com/6963553/immigration-u-s-economy/), April 2024.\n  * Migration Policy Institute, [Beyond the \u201cBlack Jobs\u201d Controversy: Immigrants and U.S.-Born Black Workers Share a Growing Jobs Pie](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/beyond-black-jobs-controversy), August 2024."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "82c40bed-f96e-5002-834b-58af3b351e1a", "url": "https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2016/1/27/the-effects-of-immigration-on-the-united-states-economy", "title": "The Effects of Immigration on the United States' Economy", "excerpts": ["The Effects of Immigration on the United States\u2019 Economy \u2014 Penn Wharton Budget Model\nThe Effects of Immigration on the United States\u2019 Economy\n  * While some policymakers have blamed immigration for slowing U.S. wage growth since the 1970s, most academic research finds little long run effect on Americans\u2019 wages.\n  * The available evidence suggests that immigration leads to more innovation, a better educated workforce, greater occupational specialization, better matching of skills with jobs, and higher overall economic productivity. \n  * Immigration also has a net positive effect on combined federal, state, and local budgets.

Even though immigrants assimilate faster in the United States compared to developed European nations, immigration policy has become a highly contentious issue in America. While much of the debate centers on cultural issues, the economic effects of immigration are clear: Economic analysis finds little support for the view that inflows of foreign labor have reduced jobs or Americans\u2019 wages. Economic theory predictions and the bulk of academic research confirms that wages are unaffected by immigration over the long-term and that the economic effects of immigration are mostly positive for natives and for the overall economy. \nFigure 1 shows that the foreign-born population has grown rapidly in recent decades, rising from less than 5 percent of the U.S. population in 1970 to 13 percent in 2013. Although immigrants today comprise a larger share of the population than at any time since World War II, the foreign-born share today is roughly the same as during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when about 15 percent of U.S. residents were born in a foreign country.\nFigure 1: Foreign-Born Share of U.S. Population, 1850-2013", "Has the surge in immigration since 1970 led to slower wage growth for native-born workers? Academic research does not provide much support for this claim. The evidence suggests that when immigration increases the supply of labor, firms increase investment to offset any reduction in capital per worker, thereby keeping average wages from falling over the long term. Moreover, immigrants are often imperfect substitutes for native-born workers in U.S. labor markets. That means they do not compete for the same jobs and put minimal downward pressure on natives\u2019 wages. This might explain why competition from new immigrants has mostly affected earlier immigrants, who experienced significant reductions in wages from the surge in immigration. In contrast, studies find that immigration has actually raised average wages of native-born workers during the last few decades. \nImmigrants are at the forefront of innovation and ingenuity in the United States, accounting for a disproportionately high share of patent filings, science and technology graduates, and senior positions at top venture capital-funded firms. In addition, the presence of immigrants often creates opportunities for less-skilled native workers to become more specialized in their work, thereby increasing their productivity. \nImmigration generally also improves the government\u2019s fiscal situation, as many immigrants pay more in taxes over a lifetime than they consume in government services. However, native-born residents of states with large concentrations of less-educated immigrants may face larger tax burdens, as these immigrants pay less in taxes and are more likely to send children to public schools.", "A popular view is that immigrants are taking jobs from American citizens. However, although immigrants increase the supply of labor, they also spend their wages on homes, food, TVs and other goods and services and expand domestic economic demand. This increased demand, in turn, generates more jobs to build those homes, make and sell food, and transport TVs.\nMost empirical studies indicate long-term benefits for natives\u2019 employment and wages from immigration, although some studies suggest that these gains come at the cost of short-term losses from lower wages and higher unemployment.\nStandard economic theory implies that while higher labor supply from immigration may initially depress wages, over time firms increase investment to restore the amount of capital per worker, which then restores wages. Steady growth in the capital-labor ratio prevents workers\u2019 average productivity, and therefore their average wages from declining over the long run. Figure 2 shows the pre-1980 trend in the capital-labor ratio extrapolated over the next few decades \u2013 the period when U.S. immigration accelerated. Consistent with the theory, the actual capital-labor ratio did not significantly or permanently deviate from that trend after 1980. \nFigure 2: U.S. Log Capital-Labor Ratio, 1948-2013 \nLog capital services per worker and trend, business sector. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics and author's calculations.", "While growth in the capital stock keeps average wages from falling, immigration may affect the relative wages of different types of workers by changing their relative supplies. As shown in Table 1, immigration over the last few decades has had a bimodal impact across education groups: The largest impact has been on the supply of workers without a high school degree and of workers at the high end of the education spectrum \u2013 those with a college or postgraduate degree. Relative to the native-born, recently-arrived immigrants are less likely to have completed high school. At the same time, at the higher end, recent immigrants are more likely to have completed college and hold advanced degrees than their native counterparts.\nThus, immigration has primarily raised the supplies of the least and the most skilled workers. \nTable 1.

This does not include thousands more arriving through other routes. Many are asylum seekers fleeing war or violence, and others do not meet this official definition but are hoping to escape climate crises or economic deprivation and seek new hope in the fabled Land of Opportunity. Despite prevailing narratives, immigrants, on average, contribute substantially to US society.

My family was part of the wave of refugees from the Middle East that I now study in some of my own research. Fleeing civil war, we lived in several Middle Eastern countries\u2014including in the Persian Gulf during the 1991 Gulf War\u2014before moving permanently to the United States in the 1990s. My parents received the Earned Income Tax Credit and food stamps (now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP]). While we have also faced our share of government-sanctioned hardships, the support that my family received in our first years in the United States helped us to thrive, and ultimately enabled me to now conduct research on the same safety-net policies I once received, from a place of privilege in academia.\nResearch in the social sciences suggests that social inclusion of refugees and other vulnerable immigrants has pay-offs for economic and social outcomes as well. These benefits accrue to both the immigrants themselves as well as their broader communities. For example, one study exploited a natural experiment created by a California policy allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, finding that it improved traffic safety, specifically by reducing the number of hit-and-run accidents. Another study in several major US cities found that supporting naturalization of eligible immigrants not only increased their earnings and homeownership rates but also increased tax revenues in their cities of residence and, in most cases, decreased the overall cost of public benefits. This report conducted by the Urban Institute was sponsored by the Office of Immigrant Affairs in New York City, which is among the cities most affected by the current influx of asylum seekers, and where political debates are raging about how far to go in accommodating these newcomers.", "While there is more limited quasi-experimental research on how US policies that support social inclusion of at-risk immigrants influence health, a handful of studies have suggested the potential benefits. For example, studies of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program\u2014a 2012 policy that prevented deportation for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children\u2014have demonstrated that it resulted in improved mental health for both the DACA beneficiaries themselves during adulthood, as well as their own children."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "2d012d90-2445-5908-9bf1-2fd197af5264", "url": "https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/how-does-immigration-affect-us-economy", "title": "How Does Immigration Affect the U.S. Economy?", "excerpts": ["How Does Immigration Affect the U.S. Economy?      Current political and economic issues succinctly explained.\nImmigration has historically driven U.S. growth and filled labor shortages in various sectors, but it has also remained one of the most politically divisive issues.

Skepticism about whether new arrivals can assimilate into American society was a key concern in the 2016 presidential election and remains an ongoing theme in the public debate on immigration policy. This controversy is not new. The U.S. has experienced repeated waves of hostility toward immigrants and today\u2019s concerns echo alarms sounded often in the past. Both today and in earlier times, many in this country have viewed immigrants as a threat to the integrity of the nation\u2019s culture, fearing that foreigners among us somehow make America less American. Consider the following statement: Immigration \u201cis bringing to the country people whom it is very difficult to assimilate and who do not promise well for the standard of civilization in the United States.\u201d The speaker was not Donald Trump on the campaign trail but Massachusetts Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge in 1891.\nThe immigration debate raises a fundamental issue: Are immigrants able to successfully integrate into American society by adopting the economic, social, and cultural norms of native-born Americans? Or are they likely to remain an alien presence inside our borders long after they settle here? This argument typically generates more heat than light. Many people have opinions on the subject, but relatively little empirical evidence is available on how fully and quickly immigrants assimilate into U.S. culture.", "Leah Boustan of UCLA, Katherine Eriksson of UC Davis, and I have tried to fill part of this gap by looking at immigration during the Age of Mass Migration from 1850 to 1913, when U.S. borders were open and 30 million Europeans picked up stakes to move here. By the early 20th century, some 15 percent of the U.S. population was foreign born, comparable to the share today. If we want to know how today\u2019s newcomers will fare, we can find important clues by examining what happened to those who arrived on our shores during the greatest surge of immigration in U.S. history.\nIn our previous work on immigration, my co-authors and I looked at occupation data of immigrants who arrived during the Age of Mass Migration. The classic narrative is that penniless immigrants worked low-paying jobs to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, eventually reaching equality of skills and income with natives. We found that story to be largely a myth. On average, long-term immigrants and natives held jobs at similar skill levels and climbed the occupational ladder at about the same pace. We did find considerable variation though. Immigrants from richer countries, such as England or Germany, often worked in higher-skilled occupations than natives, while those from poorer countries, such as Italy or Russia, often were in less-skilled occupations. But, regardless of the starting point, the initial gaps between immigrants and natives persisted throughout their lives. These findings provide useful data on the experiences of immigrants in the U.S. labor market. But it\u2019s important to stress that even immigrants who lag economically may successfully assimilate into American society.", "Measuring cultural assimilation is a challenge because data on cultural practices\u2014things like food, dress, and accent\u2014are not systematically collected. But the names that parents choose for their children are collected, offering a revealing window into the cultural assimilation process. Using 2 million census records from 1920 and 1940, we constructed a foreignness index indicating the probability that a given name would be held by a foreigner or a native.\nFor example, people with names like Hyman or Vito were almost certain to be children of immigrants, while youngsters with names like Clay or Lowell were likely to have native parents. In this respect, children\u2019s names are signals of cultural identity. Giving a child an American-sounding name is a financially cost-free way of identifying with U.S. culture. Thus, we can trace the assimilation process by examining changes in the names immigrants gave their offspring as they spent more time in the U.S.\nOur key finding is that for immigrants who arrived in the 1900s and 1910s, the more time they spent in the U.S., the less likely they were to give their children foreign-sounding names. Figure 1 shows that after 20 years in this country, half of the gap in name choice between immigrants and natives had disappeared. The shift in name choice happened at a roughly equal pace for sons and daughters and among poor and rich families.\nHowever, the pace varied significantly depending on country of origin. Immigrants from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark were among the quickest to adopt American-sounding names, followed by Italians and other Southern Europeans. Russians, including many Russian Jews, and Finns had the slowest rates of name-based assimilation. This convergence of names chosen by immigrant and native populations is suggestive evidence of cultural assimilation. But the fact that immigrants didn\u2019t fully adopt native naming patterns suggests that many valued retaining a distinct cultural identity.", "Having an American-sounding name was a badge of assimilation that conferred genuine economic and social benefits. We looked at census records of more than a million children of immigrants from 1920, when they lived with their childhood families, through 1940, when they were adults.\nChildren with less-foreign-sounding names completed more years of schooling, earned more, and were less likely to be unemployed than their counterparts whose names sounded more foreign. In addition, they were less likely to marry someone born abroad or with a foreign-sounding name. These patterns held even among brothers within the same family. The data suggest that, while a foreign-sounding name reinforced a sense of ethnic identity, it may have exposed individuals to discrimination at school or on the job.\nOther measures reinforce the picture of early 20th century immigrants gradually taking on American cultural markers. By 1930, more than two-thirds of immigrants had applied for citizenship and almost all reported they could speak some English. A third of first-generation immigrants who arrived unmarried and more than half of second-generation immigrants wed spouses from outside their cultural group.\nThese findings suggest that over time immigrants\u2019 sense of separateness weakened and their identification with U.S. culture grew stronger. The gradual adoption of American-sounding names appears to have been part of a process of assimilation in which newcomers learned U.S. culture, made a commitment to build roots in this country, and came to identify as Americans.", "Some may have arrived with a strong desire to assimilate, but little knowledge of how to do so. They may not even have known which names were common in the U.S. Others may not have cared about assimilating at first, but eventually felt the urge to blend in. In both cases, as time went by, they may have started to navigate the dominant culture with greater ease. Their children may have attended schools with children from other cultures and have spoken with American accents.\nWhat does this tell us about the assimilation process? We can imagine that after many years in the U.S., immigrants, like natives, become baseball fans, eat hamburgers, and watch fireworks on the Fourth of July. To be sure, their connections with their countries of origin are not obliterated. Instead, they may come to see themselves as hyphenated Americans, but Americans nonetheless.\nWhat\u2019s more, policies that attempt to force cultural assimilation on immigrants may backlash. Fouka (2015) finds that German immigrants in states that introduced anti-German language policies during World War I responded by choosing visibly German names, perhaps as a show of community support."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "6a05677a-7120-571d-8081-c80f4b620db1", "url": "https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/4942/chapter/5", "title": "Chapter: 3 Effects of Immigration and Assimilation", "excerpts": ["##  3 Effects of Immigration and Assimilation \nVisit to get more information about this book, to buy it in print, or to download it as a free PDF. \n\"3 Effects of Immigration and Assimilation.\" National Research Council. 1996. _Statistics on U.S. Immigration: An Assessment of Data Needs for Future Research_.

Much folk wisdom has viewed assimilation as a linear process of progressive improvement and adjustment to American society. The general assumption is guided by an implicit deficit model: to advance socially and economically in the United States, immigrants need to \"become American\" in order to overcome their deficits in the new language and culture. As they shed the old and acquire the new, they acquire skills for working positively and effectively\u2014a process that may not be completed until the second or third generation after entry.", "Today's immigration is overwhelmingly composed of newcomers from Asia and Latin America, areas with significantly different languages and cultures than those of previous European immigrants in the late 1800s and earlier decades of the 1900s. Concerns have been raised about the speed and degree to which these immigrants can assimilate\u2014and hence about the social \"costs\" of these new immigrants\u2014before they begin to produce net benefits to their new society. The traditional assumption is that immigrants have costs to U.S. society in the initial period after arrival, but that the costs decrease and the benefits to society increase as duration of residence increases. It is further assumed that the benefits to society also increase with greater assimilation to American culture. Recent research findings, however, especially in the areas of perinatal health, mental health, and education, raise significant questions about such assumptions. Indeed, some of the findings run precisely opposite to what might be expected from traditional notions and theories of assimilation.\n\"3 Effects of Immigration and Assimilation.\" National Research Council. 1996. _Statistics on U.S. Immigration: An Assessment of Data Needs for Future Research_. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/4942. \nThis chapter captures the workshop discussions of the effects of immigration and assimilation on social policies and programs, health, and education.", "Immigration researchers disagree about many major issues that are essential for revising social policy, including the criteria used to admit immigrants and the extent of social supports required to ensure their successful integration. More specific areas of disagreement include: whether recent arrivals are less skilled than earlier arrivals; whether the pace of socioeconomic assimilation has slowed in recent years and, if so, why; whether the net social and economic impacts of immigration are positive or negative; which social groups and communities are the net beneficiaries (or losers) from the influx of new immigrants; whether legal immigrants, illegal aliens, and refugees face dissimilar prospects for integration in the United States and, if so, why; and whether the criteria currently used to admit immigrants are optimal for achieving social, political, humanitarian, and economic objectives. All analysts agree that reliable answers to all of these questions are necessary for future policy initiatives concerned with employment, schooling, and income maintenance.\nDespite the many areas of disagreement among immigration experts, there is widespread consensus on three issues: (1) the volume of immigration is likely to increase over the next decade, (2) the demographic and socioeconomic diversity of the flows has increased in recent decades, and (3) currently available data are ill-suited to address adequately many policy-relevant questions about how immigration contributes to contemporary patterns of stratification.", "One of the most serious deficiencies in the area of immigration and economic inequality is the absence of information about income and employment dynamics among various segments of the foreign-born population. Virtually all national estimates of immigrant employment, poverty, and welfare participation are based on data from the decennial census or the Current Population Survey. Although static measures of poverty status and welfare participation are useful for portraying aggregate trends and differentials in the prevalence of poverty in a given year, they do not illustrate the dynamics of income stratification processes. These tasks cannot be accomplished with currently existing data because administrative records on program participation seldom include nativity identifiers, and because nationally representative longitudinal or cross-sectional surveys seldom provide sufficient detail on type of program participation, much less duration of\nThis section draws on the paper presented at the workshop by Maria Tienda.  \n\"3 Effects of Immigration and Assimilation.\" National Research Council. 1996. _Statistics on U.S. Immigration: An Assessment of Data Needs for Future Research_.

Although the Survey of Income and Program Participation is suitable to address these questions and others about income and employment dynamics, items about immigrant status are now available only on the topical modules (i.e., questions on selected special attachments to the main questionnaire).", "A review of the Survey of Income and Program Participation by a panel of the Committee on National Statistics (Citro and Kalton, 1993) recommended a number of changes for improving the survey. Because it is the preeminent source of survey data on the use of public services, information from the survey has great potential for contributing to current debates about the use of welfare, medical care, and other social services by immigrants. But to serve current policy analysis requirements, information is needed on potentially illegal statuses\u2014a difficult challenge for any survey research. Workshop discussion did not address problems of such data collection, but such enhancement of the survey is worth further consideration. A further limitation of these data are the relatively small sample sizes of the Asian and Hispanic populations, which preclude detailed analyses of specific nationality groups.\nFurther advances toward understanding the process of socioeconomic integration of immigrants require a longitudinal analysis of employment and income dynamics. This is essential to determine if rising inequality among various groups of immigrants and their native-born counterparts results from greater numbers experiencing transitory or chronic episodes of joblessness, poverty, and welfare dependence. Studies of employment and income dynamics among immigrants should also help to clarify inconsistencies in current research regarding the relationship between length of U.S. residence and economic well-being. Longitudinal analyses of income and program participation among the foreign-born population are a necessary adjunct to policy because the program implications of transitory episodes of poverty and welfare participation differ appreciably from chronic dependence."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "ea4904da-6388-53c4-92ce-e6b64e815bc4", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596724000568", "title": "Changing the pace of the melting pot", "excerpts": ["Please confirm you are a human by completing the captcha challenge below.\n  * Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 Chrome/116.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "0f522f2b-b8c7-5f2a-9d4e-24159d4ad550", "url": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3634592/", "title": "The Adaptation of the Immigrant Second Generation in America", "excerpts": ["A website belongs to an official government organization in the United States. \nSecure .gov websites use HTTPS A ( ) or means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

The four field waves of the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS) are described and the main theoretical models emerging from it are presented and graphically summarised. After considering critical views of this theory, we present the most recent results from this longitudinal research program in the forum of quantitative models predicting downward assimilation in early adulthood and qualitative interviews identifying ways to escape it by disadvantaged children of immigrants. Quantitative results strongly support the predicted effects of exogenous variables identified by segmented assimilation theory and identify the intervening factors during adolescence that mediate their influence on adult outcomes. Qualitative evidence gathered during the last stage of the study points to three factors that can lead to exceptional educational achievement among disadvantaged youths. All three indicate the positive influence of selective acculturation. Implications of these findings for theory and policy are discussed.\nsegmented assimilation, selective acculturation, significant others, cultural capital, second generation", "Back in 1990 when Rub\u00e9n Rumbaut and Alejandro Portes launched a longitudinal study of the second generation, the field of immigration studies in American social science was still not very popular and the bulk of it concentrated on adult immigrants, particularly the undocumented. The reason that led us to turn attention to the children was the realization that the long-term effects of immigration on American society would be determined less by the first than by the second generation and that the prognosis for this outcome was not as rosy as the dominant theories of the time would lead us to believe. First generation immigrants have always been a flighty bunch, here today and gone tomorrow, the society, but not yet it. By contrast, their U.S.-born and reared children are, overwhelmingly, here to stay and, as citizens, fully entitled to \u2018voice\u2019 in the American political system (in sense of the term). Hence, the course of their adaptation will determine, to a greater extent than other factors, the long-term destiny of the ethnic groups spawned by today\u2019s immigration.", "In a prescient article, argued that the future of children of immigrants growing up at present in America might not be as straightforward as the optimistic conclusions derived from the then-dominant assimilation perspective. Gans noted that many immigrants came from modest class backgrounds, bringing very scarce human capital that did not equip them to steer their offspring around the complexities of the American educational system. In an increasingly knowledge-based economy, children of immigrants without an advanced education would not be able to access the jobs that provided them with a ticket to the upper-middle classes and may stagnate into manual, low-wage work not too different from that performed by their parents. Those unwilling to do so because of heightened American-style aspirations would live frustrated lives or, more poignantly, would be tempted to join the gangs and drug culture ravaging American inner cities.\nPortes and Rumbaut had just completed the first edition of (1990) and it became clear that Gans was on to something: the condition of today\u2019s children of immigrants stood in need of serious scrutiny. Accordingly, we decided to launch an empirical study of the question on the basis of a large sample of second generation students in the school systems of two of the main metropolitan areas of immigrant concentration \u2013Miami/Ft. Lauderdale and San Diego. In 1992, Portes and Zhou published a theoretical article that sought to bring together Gans\u2019 premonitions with what we had learned so far from our preliminary studies.", "The argument was that the imagery of a uniform assimilation path did not do justice to what was taking place on the ground. Instead, the process had become into several distinct paths, some leading upwards but others downward. These alternative outcomes reflect the barriers to adaptation encountered by second generation youths in today\u2019s America and the social and economic resources to confront them that they and their families possess ().\nBy 1996, the first survey of the Children of Immigrants\u2019 Longitudinal Study (CILS) was completed and analyzed and Rumbaut and Portes could present the results, along with a more refined version of the segmented assimilation model, in the second edition of , published in the same year. Simultaneously, these two authors were completing the second follow-up survey of CILS, together with a survey of our respondents\u2019 parents. Results of the full study appeared in a set of two volumes, _Legacies: The Story of the Immigrant Second Generation_ () and _Ethnicities: Children of Immigrants in America_ ().

Silas W. Allard, Kristin E.

The foreign-born and their descendants continue to integrate in the United States, although with variances based on their \u201cstarting points and on the segment of American society \u2026 into which they integrate\u201d (NAS 2015, 3, 268). Yet, the United States trails other developed nations by standard integration metrics, and its more than 44 million immigrants encounter challenges and conditions, such as rising nativism, outdated immigration policies, administrative strategies that serve to \u201cdisintegrate\u201d immigrant families and communities, and a rapidly changing labor market due to automation, robotization, and artificial intelligence. The paper explores competing versions of integration, including a Christian vision rooted in a commitment to human dignity and the full participation of immigrants in their communities and nations. Integration will always be conditioned by its local and national context, but the issues discussed in this chapter pertain to a wide variety of countries.\n_\u201cPerhaps we made the mistake of establishing ourselves in a country that is not ours, but we already took roots here through our children. Shouldn\u2019t the government be more flexible for them? My oldest son asks: \u2018Where are my rights as a U.S. citizen? Where is my right to live with my family and have a home?\u2019\u201d_\nMother of three U.S. citizen children and wife of a deported immigrant", "_\u201cYou know, they have a word. It sort of became old-fashioned. It\u2019s called a nationalist \u2026. You know what I am. I\u2019m a nationalist, okay. I\u2019m a nationalist.\u201d_\nIn _Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1869-1925_ , the historian John Higham credited the nation\u2019s success at integrating immigrants in the 19 century to the desire of immigrants \u201cto share\u201d in the nation\u2019s life and the willingness of Americans not to demand too high a \u201clevel of solidarity\u201d from them (Higham 1975, 234-235). Instead, the nation mostly \u201ctrust[ed] in the ordinary processes of a free society\u201d to meld \u201cmany peoples into one\u201d (ibid., 234). The Americanization movement in the late 19 and early 20 centuries, which peaked during World War I, departed from this approach. Driven by fear of divided immigrant loyalties, the United States invested heavily in English and civics classes, insisted that immigrants naturalize, adopted \u201cAmerica First\u201d and other slogans, and embarked on a public/private crusade to instill allegiance to the nation (ibid., 242-247).\nA comprehensive 2015 report on integration by The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NAS) recalled the Europeans who immigrated in the early 20 century with little education and high levels of illiteracy, and whose children entered the labor market in the midst of the Great Depression. Despite these immense challenges, this generation of immigrants and their descendants successfully integrated over time, a process enabled, in large part, by the expanding U.S. economy after World War II (NAS 2015, 248-249). Today\u2019s immigrants and their descendants continue to integrate, albeit with variances based on their \u201cstarting points and on the segment of American society\u2014the racial and ethnic groups, the legal status, the social class, and the geographic area\u2014into which they integrate\u201d (NAS 2015, 3, 268).", "The question arises, however: will the nation\u2019s historic genius at integrating immigrants persist? With a record 44 million foreign-born U.S. residents and nearly double that number counting their US-born children, the stakes could not be higher. This chapter will explore the integration successes and challenges of U.S. immigrants and their progeny. It examines the conditions in receiving societies that improve and diminish the integration prospects of immigrants. These include, on the one hand, rising nationalism, nativism, and a rapidly changing labor market due to automation, robotization, and artificial intelligence, and, on the other hand, integration initiatives and strong mediating institutions.\nThe chapter will begin by exploring different conceptions of integration, and conclude by reflecting on how Christianity might inform national and local integration policies. While this chapter focuses on the U.S. context, the issues discussed are pertinent in a wide variety of countries experiencing significant immigration.", "The European Union (EU) has provided a helpful starting point for conceptualizing integration. In 2004, the EU adopted Common Basic Principles of Integration that define integration as \u201ca dynamic, two-way process of mutual accommodation by all immigrants and residents of Member States\u201d (EU 2004). This process creates rights and responsibilities on the part of the immigrant, including respect for the EU\u2019s core values and access by immigrants to states\u2019 institutions, goods, and services \u201cequal to national citizens\u201d (EU 2004). In 2011, the EU expanded this definition to reflect the role of countries of origin in facilitating integration through pre-departure initiatives, support to their diasporas, and circular migration policies (European Commission 2011). Several international processes, dialogues, and agreements have underscored the need for integration strategies that foreground human agency and that benefit both immigrants and receiving communities, making them more likely to garner public support.\nWhile liberal democracies, supranational entities, and regional and international agreements envision integration as a process leading to the full participation of immigrants in their new communities, this view is not universal. A growing number of countries define themselves in terms of a common origin, race, ethnicity, religion, or exclusionary culture. Furthermore, the fundamental character of a country strongly influences the reception of immigrants, their success at integrating, and even the perception of what constitutes integration. Gulf Cooperation Council states, for example, have relatively open labor migration policies and immense foreign-born populations. However, they equate integration with the incorporation of foreign workers into their labor markets, without access to the rights, services, or benefits of citizenship.", "Christianity\u2019s core belief in universal human dignity and its global reach align with a vision of integration that responds holistically to immigrants as human beings and sees them as fully contributing members to the good of their communities. In that vein, U.S. settlement house leaders of the late 19 and early 20 centuries believed that each immigrant group should be encouraged to contribute their gifts and the best of their own traditions to their new country (Higham 1975, 121, 252). In living with immigrants, they learned that countries could most effectively promote integration by offering immigrants a home and embracing their gifts, rather than seeking to erase their heritages (ibid., 256).\nPope Francis understands integration as \u201cneither assimilation nor incorporation,\u201d but \u201crooted essentially in the joint recognition of the other\u2019s cultural richness: it is not the superimposing of one culture over another, nor mutual isolation, with the insidious and dangerous risk of creating ghettoes\u201d (Francis 2017). By this vision, integration is more than socio-economic advancement over generations. It provides an opportunity to build more just and inclusive societies, promote human flourishing, and unify culturally diverse persons based on their deepest values and longings.\n# How Immigrants in the U.S. are Faring\nSocial scientists take a more analytical approach to integration, examining metrics like educational attainment, income, political participation, occupational distribution, residential integration, intermarriage, homeownership, language proficiency, naturalization rates, and sense of belonging. The 2015 NAS study found \u201csubstantial\u201d socioeconomic integration\u2014measured by education, occupation, earnings and poverty\u2014by immigrants and their US-born descendants, with many qualifications and caveats.

(Photo: Library of Congress)\nAs host to more immigrants than any other country, the United States has been shaped and reshaped by immigration over the centuries demographically, economically, culturally, socially, and politically. Newcomers have driven fundamental U.S. transformations during four peak periods of significant immigration: establishment of the British colonies, westward expansion and the shift to an agricultural economy in the 19th century, the rise of cities and manufacturing at the turn of the 20th century, and the recent dominance of a services- and knowledge-based economy beginning in the 1970s and continuing today.\nEven as immigration has been a regular feature of American life, it has also been historically contentious and in recent decades has been seen through an increasingly partisan lens. While the United States continues to rely on immigration to bolster population growth, for family reunification, and to fill job needs, the system no longer keeps pace with these demands. The country\u2019s present-day immigration framework was mostly constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, and the last major legislative reforms occurred in 1996. Since then, immigration has become a partisan wedge issue within Congress and the country, with fights chiefly concentrated on the fate of the estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States, one of the largest such populations in the world, and enforcement measures at the U.S.-Mexico border. In the face of serious roadblocks to changing immigration laws, recent presidential administrations have increasingly governed through executive action, which has allowed them each to put their mark on the system\u2014at least temporarily.", "Although the foundational tenets of the immigration system have remained mostly unchanged over the past several decades, the immigrant population has grown significantly. As of 2019, 44.9 million immigrants lived in the United States\u2014more than double the 1990 number\u2014representing nearly 14 percent of the country\u2019s total population, the highest share since 1910. Immigrant origins are also shifting, with recent arrivals from China and India outpacing those from Mexico, and the overall number of Mexican immigrants declining since 2010. And after peaking at an estimated 12.3 million in 2007, the unauthorized immigrant population has decreased and mostly leveled out around 11 million.\nAs a result of these shifts, anxieties that have traditionally accompanied sizeable demographic changes, post-9/11 policies that rooted immigration in a new national security narrative, and other factors, immigration has become central to U.S. political debates, helping to propel leaders with ardent but strongly diverging views on the issue. Attempts at major legislative reform have crumbled in the face of such increasing partisanship. This article covers the history of immigration to the United States, provides data on the size and characteristics of the present-day immigrant population, and reviews prospects for future developments.\nHow Has the Approach to Immigration Changed Throughout U.S. History?\nPrior to 1880, immigration to the United States was primarily European, driven by forces including religious and political persecution, crop failure, and the expanding frontiers of the American West and the U.S. industrial revolution. Arrivals of enslaved people from Africa and the Caribbean were high throughout the 18th century but declined dramatically after 1810 and ended in 1861. Chinese immigrants began to arrive in large numbers after gold was discovered in California in 1848.", "It was only in 1875 that the U.S. government began to restrict immigration; until that time, virtually all arrivals were admitted. The Immigration Act of 1875 (also known as the Page Act) barred the admission of criminals and made it a felony to import Asian forced laborers and Chinese women. The 1882 Immigration Act further prohibited entry of anyone deemed a \"convict, lunatic, idiot, or person unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge,\u201d and set a fee for arriving noncitizens that would be used to regulate immigration. As the gold rush ended, animosity toward Chinese laborers and other immigrants surged, leading to a further series of racially restrictive immigration laws. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 halted immigration of Chinese laborers for ten years, barred Chinese naturalization, and provided for the deportation of unauthorized Chinese immigrants. Follow-on laws in 1888 and 1892 further restricted immigration from China.\nBetween 1880 and 1930, more than 27 million immigrants arrived, mainly from Europe and Canada. This peak immigration period\u2014the last major wave prior to the current era\u2014also led to new restrictions. Among them was the 1917 Immigration Act, which prohibited immigration from a newly drawn \"Asiatic barred zone\" covering most of South and Southeast Asia and nearly the entire Middle East, as well as other groups of migrants such as those who could not pass a literacy test. The Immigration Act of 1924 (also known as the Johnson-Reed Act) established the national-origins quota system, which set a ceiling on the number of immigrants allowed from each country, highly preferencing those from Northern and Western Europe. The 1924 law included no provisions for immigration from South and Central America or Mexico.\n_The Creation of the Modern U.S. Immigration System_", "Two decades later, the tides slowly started to turn. In 1943, the Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed after more than 60 years. The 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act continued the national-origins quota system but for the first time allocated a quota for Asian countries. A new philosophy guiding immigration eventually took hold as part the nation's civil-rights movement, and the resulting Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965 (the Hart-Cellar Act) repealed the national-origins quota system and replaced it with a seven-category preference system based primarily on family unification. By ending strong preferences for European migration and increasing numerical limits on immigration, the landmark 1965 law set in motion powerful forces that still shape the United States today. Immigration flows that had long been dominated by Europeans gave way to predominantly Latin American and Asian immigration.\nFigure 1. U.S. Immigrant Population by Region of Birth, 1960-2019\n: Migration Policy Institute (MPI), \u201cU.S. Immigrant Population by World Region of Birth, 1960-2019,\u201d MPI Migration Data Hub, accessed December 9, 2021, .\nThe Hart-Cellar Act also for the first time created a permanent admissions category for refugees. Previously, refugees had been allowed into the United States only under the attorney general\u2019s parole authority (this power continued to be used after 1965 to admit refugees beyond the admissions cap). Later, the Refugee Act of 1980 established the modern U.S. refugee system, including authorizing the president to set annual admissions targets, creating the asylum system, and providing a pathway to permanent residence for refugees and asylees.", "Though Congress in 1964 terminated the World War II-era Bracero program used to recruit Mexican workers for U.S. farms, the 1965 Act helped usher in a new era of migration from Mexico. As Mexico became the largest source country for legal admissions, it also became the origin for a growing population of unauthorized migrants coming in search of jobs; by the mid-1980s, an estimated 3 million to 5 million immigrants were living unlawfully in the country.\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) was intended to address and end illegal immigration with a \"three-legged stool\u201d approach: penalize employers who knowingly hired unauthorized immigrants, increase border enforcement, and offer legal status to unauthorized immigrants who had lived in the United States for at least five years (with more leniency for agricultural workers). The law granted legal status to 2.7 million individuals, but it never accomplished its goal of ending illegal immigration. Many unauthorized immigrants were not eligible for legalization under the law\u2019s provisions, and the measure also did not provide for newly legalized immigrants to reunite with their relatives. Meanwhile, policing of employers was minimal and border enforcement was slow to scale up.\nFour years later, the Immigration Act of 1990 sought to ease entry for highly skilled immigrants by raising legal immigration caps, creating a preference system for employment-based immigration, and modifying categories for temporary visas, among other changes. It also established Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nationals of countries deemed unsafe for return because of armed conflict or natural disaster, as well as the Diversity Visa Program, which allots green cards for immigrants from countries with little immigration to the United States."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "0f4feb33-b79d-5c1d-980e-5e505408ee43", "url": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3856769/", "title": "The Contributions of Immigrants to American Culture - PMC", "excerpts": ["A website belongs to an official government organization in the United States. \nSecure .gov websites use HTTPS A ( ) or means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

This analysis typically ignores the significant contributions of immigrants to the creation of American culture through the performing arts, sciences, and other cultural pursuits. Immigrants and their children are not born with more creative talents than native-born citizens, but their selectivity and marginality may have pushed and pulled those with ability into high-risk career paths that reward creative work. The presence of large numbers of talented immigrants in Hollywood, academia, and the high-tech industries has pushed American institutions to be more meritocratic and open to innovation than they would be otherwise.\nThe lives of most immigrants are a dialectic between the memories of the world left behind and the day-to-day struggles of learning the ropes of a new society. Mastering a new language, living and working among strangers, and coping with the unfamiliar are only some of the challenges faced by immigrants. It is no wonder that nostalgia has a strong grip on the cultural pursuits of immigrants. Immigrant communities generally find comfort in familiar religious traditions and rituals, seek out newspapers and literature from the homeland, and celebrate holidays and special occasions with traditional music, dance, cuisine, and leisure-time pursuits.", "Yet not all immigrants look solely to the past to find meaning or to express their longings. Some immigrants, and their children in particular, are inspired by the possibility for innovative expression in American arts, culture, and pastimes. The partially fictionalized biography of the popular entertainer Al Jolson captures this experience. Jolson's story was expressed, somewhat embellished, in the 1946 Oscar-winning film , and was foretold in the 1927 film , in which Jolson plays the lead role.\nAsa Yoelson, born in 1886 in Russia, immigrated to the United States as a child. He had a beautiful singing voice and was groomed to succeed his father as the cantor in a prominent synagogue. However, Asa was torn between family expectations and his desire to become a popular singer. After some hesitation, he left home to try his fortune as a singer in vaudeville and other venues. Within a few years, Asa Yoelson\u2013who adopted the stage name Al Jolson\u2013achieved fame as a popular singer and stage performer. During the 1920s and 1930s, he was the most highly paid entertainer in the country. The transition from Asa Yoelson, the dutiful son, to Al Jolson, famous entertainer, can be interpreted several ways. The Hollywood story of Jolson's life illustrates the popular belief that America is a land of opportunity for talented and hardworking immigrants: \u201cWhere else on earth could this sort of thing happen?\u201d Another interpretation is the clash between immigrant generations\u2013between the immigrant parents' belief in the obligation to maintain tradition and their Americanized children's desire for broader fulfillment. Although initially disowned by his father for leaving home and breaking with tradition, Asa/Al eventually reconciled with his family.", "There is an even more important, and surprising, element to the Al Jolson story. How did an outsider, ethnically and culturally, become the cultural icon whose style set the standard for twentieth-century popular musical performance? Jolson climbed to the top of the ladder of the American entertainment industry by redefining the role and image of a public performer. He brought the expressionism and style of jazz to popular audiences, his singing connected with stage and film audiences through his dramatic emotional and physical performance, and he had stage runways built so that he could perform closer to the audience. The Jolson style did not represent assimilation, but rather the creation of a distinctive \u201cAmerican\u201d genre of musical performance. Many iconic American popular singers of the twentieth century, including Bing Crosby, Tony Bennett, Judy Garland, Eddie Fisher, and Neil Diamond, report that Jolson's style was a formative influence on their careers.", "Al Jolson was not an exception. Immigrants, and especially the children and grandchildren of immigrants, have played a disproportionate role in the development of the American performing arts. They have also made fundamental contributions in many other realms of artistic, cultural, culinary, athletic, and scientific endeavor. Immigrants and their children are not born with more ability than anyone else. However, an immigrant (outsider) heritage may offer certain creative advantages to the miniscule fraction of persons possessing extraordinary talents. These advantages include: a resilience and determination to succeed, a curiosity and openness to innovation born of marginality, and an attraction to high-risk pursuits (because conventional careers are less open to them). The relative openness of American performing and cultural arts to outsiders might be explained by a variety of factors. The arrival of a very large pool of talented immigrants\u2013some fleeing persecution, others seeking new cultural horizons\u2013was a necessary condition. Of equal importance was the rapid growth of competitive entertainment, cultural, and scientific industries that fostered an emphasis on talent more so than pedigree."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "0d5d1bb3-915e-5545-9550-de3cdbbbd409", "url": "https://www.gc.cuny.edu/news/how-immigration-changed-us-society", "title": "How Immigration Changed U.S. Society", "excerpts": ["# How Immigration Changed U.S. Society\nIn her new book, \u201cOne Quarter of the Nation,\u201d Professor Nancy Foner examines the ways that immigrants have shaped U.S. culture and society.\nNancy Foner and her book \u201cOne Quarter of the Nation: Immigration and the Transformation of America\u201d\n\u201cImmigration\u2019s impact on this country has become so much a part of daily life that we sometimes fail to see it,\u201d says Distinguished Professor ). Sociologists typically focus on the impact of immigration on the lives of immigrants. Her latest book, [_One Quarter of the Nation: Immigration and the Transformation of America_](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691206394/one-quarter-of-the-nation), takes a different approach, examining the ways that immigrants have transformed U.S. culture and society.\nBy 2020 an unprecedented 45 million immigrants were living in the U.S., the largest number since census records have been kept, Foner notes. Together with their U.S.-born children, they totaled nearly 86 million people, or more than one quarter of the U.S. population. Foner recently discussed her book at a panel discussion at the Graduate Center as part of the Immigration Seminar Series. Following are excerpts of her remarks.\nHow immigration has led to racial shifts in the U.S. population:\nFew things have changed this country\u2019s racial picture more conspicuously than the last 50 years of immigration. For much of the 20th century, race was mainly a matter of Black and white. If we go back to 1960, fully 85% of Americans were white. When most Americans thought of minorities then, they had Black people in mind.", "Immigration has not only created a new demographic reality but also altered how Americans think about race. East Asians have become the model minority, even though, as spiking hate crimes during the pandemic remind us, they are still subject to racial prejudice and discrimination. Immigration has changed the very words we use to talk about race. The category Hispanic is a modern-day invention, rarely used 50 years ago, and is now an established category of identity among non-Hispanics as well as many with origins in Latin America (along with the terms Latino and, most recently, Latinx). \nThe impact of immigration on electoral politics:\nImmigrant-origin voters have helped transform both the Democratic and Republican electoral coalitions. As late as 1980, more whites in the U.S. identified as Democrats than as Republicans. By 2010, it was the reverse: White Republicans substantially outnumbered white Democrats. At the same time, the Democratic Party has increasingly become a party supported by non-whites. By 2019, according to a Pew survey, racial minorities made up 40% of registered voters who identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party. \nImmigration has been pivotal in these changes. On one side, it has been critical in the large growth in the share of minority registered voters in the national electorate (from 15% to 30% between 1996 and 2019) and they\u2019ve trended Democratic. On the other side, many whites, especially non-college-educated whites, have been drawn to the Republican Party and its anti-immigrant and anti-minority appeals, motivated, in part, by anxiety, fears, and resentment that millions of overwhelmingly non-white newcomers will undermine the basic identity of the nation and marginalize and disadvantage whites.\nPositive changes in cities, rural areas, and the national economy:", "On the whole, immigration has brought enormous benefits as it has created far-reaching changes, something evident when we look at cities and towns around the country. Immigrants by their sheer numbers have provided a lifeline in many cities that were losing population; played a key role in the growth of places like Las Vegas and Orlando that were becoming major metropolitan areas for the first time; and revitalized many far-flung rural communities, slowing population loss and in some cases enabling the population to grow. In many central cities, immigration helped deteriorating neighborhoods make a comeback by lifting population and spurring economic growth; and immigration was a factor behind the decline in violent crime in urban America from the late 1990s and into the early 2000s.\nWhen it comes to the economy, immigration has fostered innovation, fueled growth, and helped to shape the development of whole industries. Immigrants practically invented Silicon Valley. They\u2019ve had an outsize role in high-tech, now one of the national economy\u2019s largest components, starting and running major new companies and spearheading innovations in them \u2014 think Google\u2019s Russian-born co-founder, Sergey Brin, or eBay\u2019s founder, Pierre Omidyar, born in France to Iranian migrant parents. In 2018, over half of the 91 U.S. startup companies valued at $1 billion or more had at least one immigrant founder; more than 80% of these companies employed immigrants in key management or product development roles, commonly as chief technology officers and vice presidents of engineering.", "Nationwide, one in five business owners in 2014 were immigrants, and they founded about a quarter of new firms. Immigrants have helped any number of service industries grow and flourish, filling essential roles at every occupational level, from picking crops to repairing houses, and have reduced shortages in medical and health care professions: 28% of the nation\u2019s physicians and surgeons and 16% of the registered nurses are immigrants. Because the millions of immigrants themselves use services and consume goods, they\u2019ve boosted the economy and job growth, including in an array of public-service jobs. \nHave immigrants hurt native workers?", "## How immigrants are broadening U.S. culture:\nImmigrants are invigorating \u2014 and indeed remaking \u2014 what we think of as our uniquely American culture: the foods we eat, the music we listen to, the films we watch, the books we read. If earlier Jewish and Italian immigrants brought us bagels and pizza, salsa today outsells ketchup and tacos are standard fare. In 2015, Chinese restaurants in the U.S. outnumbered all the McDonald\u2019s, Burger Kings, and Kentucky Fried Chickens combined, and now include a broad range of regional dishes and flavors. Immigrants and the second generation are new authors on bestseller lists. Not only do the writers highlight perennial immigrant themes, such as adjusting to American society and culture, but also contemporary issues such as undocumented status.\nThe same goes for films and TV programs with immigrant and second-generation stars, writers, and producers. Immigrants and the second generation have taken popular music in new directions. Pop music superstars with roots in Latin America have brought Latin rhythms, fused with American popular music, to mainstream audiences. At one and the same time, immigrants and the U.S.-born second generation have broadened mainstream American culture while also creating new mixtures that blend aspects of American and immigrant cultures.\n#### Related Faculty in this Story\n  *     * Distinguished Professor Emeritus, Sociology, International Migration Studies\n\nSee which Graduate Center stories drew the most attention in 2025.\nJillian Schedler, a Middle East expert, has been awarded the highest faculty honor at CUNY\nBad Bunny collaborator Jorell Mel\u00e9ndez-Badillo and Grammy-winning saxophonist Miguel Zen\u00f3n take listeners on a deep dive into Benito\u2019s latest album at a unique Graduate Center event.\nWe use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "07481e70-c993-5de2-bc48-44361918660d", "url": "https://www.nationalacademies.org/read/23550/chapter/5", "title": "Chapter: 2 Immigration to the United States: Current Trends ...", "excerpts": ["##  2 Immigration to the United States: Current Trends in Historical Perspective \nVisit to get more information about this book, to buy it in print, or to download it as a free PDF. \n\"2 Immigration to the United States: Current Trends in Historical Perspective.\" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. _The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration_.

Together, the first generation (foreign-born) and second generation (U.S.-born children of the first generation) comprise almost one in four Americans (, p. 120). Political leaders and social commentators sometimes cite these large numbers as evidence that the United States is facing an unprecedented crisis that threatens the economy and the cultural fabric of U.S. society. However, current levels of immigration, though at record highs in absolute numbers, are not out of line with those experienced for most of American history when considered relative to the total U.S. population. The United States has witnessed successive waves of mass immigration that were initially seen as crises but are now celebrated as major contributions to a \u201cnation of immigrants\u201d (; ). In the coming years, immigration will be the primary source of labor force growth in an increasingly aging population.", "Placing current and future immigrant trends and patterns into historical perspective is the objective of this chapter. In addition to setting the stage for the subsequent chapters of this report, a look backward also provides context for understanding the contentious debates over immigration. Each generation of Americans, from the founding of the republic to the present day, has wrestled with questions of who should be allowed to enter the country and to become a citizen.

At many times during U.S. history, laws and policies were enacted to restrict the entry and freedoms of different groups of newcomers. But the door was never completely closed, and peoples from almost every part of the world have continued to seek refuge and opportunity on American soil that they could not find in their home countries (; ; ).\nThe growth of the U.S. population from less than 4 million in 1790 to about 320 million in 2015 is due in no small measure to immigration. Most Americans today are the descendants of immigrants who arrived after the founding of the nation in the late 18th century (, p. 61; ). Their immigrant ancestors may not have been welcomed because their language, religion, culture, or appearance was not considered sufficiently \u201cAmerican.\u201d Yet, with the passage of generations, the children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the successive waves of immigrants have become part of the American tapestry. This multigenerational process, which involves integration of different peoples, religions, and cultures, has diversified and broadened what it means to be \u201can American\u201d ().", "Immigrants and their descendants have also been accepted, even if not fully embraced, because of their determination and enterprise. Many immigrants are willing to undertake less desirable jobs than, and to settle in locations that are shunned by, native-born workers. The children of immigrants are often distinguished by their ambition and creativity (), helping to invigorate American society and sustain this nation\u2019s world leadership in science and culture. In his 1958 book, , then-Senator John F. Kennedy claimed that the distinctive American culture of optimism and enterprise arises from our immigrant heritage.\nIn this brief survey, the panel addresses four major contemporary issues that have historical roots:\n  1. Are current levels of immigration higher than those experienced in the past?\n  2. How is immigration changing the racial and ethnic makeup of the U.S. population?\n  3. What will be the impact of immigrant workers on the U.S. economy as the Baby Boom generation departs the workforce?\n  4. How have the geographic settlement patterns of new immigrants changed in recent decades?", "To understand the significance of these issues, the chapter begins with an overview of historical trends and patterns of immigration to the United\n\"2 Immigration to the United States: Current Trends in Historical Perspective.\" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. _The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration_.

This statistical series, published in the annual _Yearbook of Immigration of Statistics_ by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is widely considered to be the standard account of immigration to the United States, even though the series provides an incomplete record of immigration for much of American history. For example, overland entries from Canada and Mexico were not counted until the early 20th century. In recent decades, the DHS figures are not the number of new arrivals but of persons receiving lawful permanent resident (LPR) status, commonly called receiving a \u201cgreen card.\u201d More than 1 million persons receive LPR status each year, but the majority of these have already been in the United States, some for many years. In addition, many other new arrivals enter the United States on temporary visas to work, study, or accompany a family member who comes to work or study. In fact, LPRs and temporary students or workers are not entirely separate populations, since over half of new LPR visas each year are \u201cstatus adjustments\u201d received by persons who were already in the United States on another visa (or even without a visa). Despite these limitations, the DHS series is the most widely used source of data for measuring long-term flows of (legal) immigrants to the United States. shows the absolute number (in thousands) of arrivals/LPRs based on the DHS data series with labels for the major immigration eras identified by in his Population Reference Bureau publication. We note that the spike in the numbers of new immigrants from 1989 to 1991 does not represent a surge of new arrivals but rather the change in legal status for the 3 million previously undocumented immigrants who received LPR status following the passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA)"]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "284a8def-364e-5ade-aadc-865626b6c33b", "url": "https://library.law.howard.edu/civilrightshistory/immigration/history", "title": "A Brief History of Civil Rights in the United States: Historical ...", "excerpts": ["# A Brief History of Civil Rights in the United States: Historical Overview - Immigration\nThis guide focuses on the civil rights that various groups have fought for within the United States.", "The history of emigration to the United States since 1778 has had multiple stages and was the result of multiple factors, both within the United States, and the immigrants' country of origin. There are multiple factors that cause emigration, including war or other social upheaval, lack of employment, economic instability, and natural disasters. There are multiple distinct eras of immigration in the United States: the revolutionary era until the end of the Civil War; the industrial era, the era of the World Wars, post-World War II, and post-9/11. The United States policy on immigration has varied widely throughout its history, which has created continual change in immigration law. Federal government policy has alternately been guided by public sentiment, but has also driven public perception of immigrants and immigration in the United States.\n#### _Revolutionary Era to the Civil War_\nUntil the break from England, he Crown did attempt to regulate and limit immigration into the Colonies. This regulation became a source of political and social tension within the Colonies. Upon establishing its independence from England the United States Congress passed an immigration act in 1790. This Naturalization Act allowed white and free immigrants to gain naturalized citizenship after having lived within the boundaries of the United States for two years. The Naturalization Act of 1795 included the stipulation that all immigrants must reject any allegiance to any foreign head of state or government and banned British citizens who fought against the United States in the Revolutionary war. It also raised the occupancy period to five years.", "Immigration and naturalization policy continued to change and evolve in response to various political and social pressures through the end of the 18th century and into the 19th century. By 1803 the geographical reach of the United States had been greatly expanded westward through the Louisiana Purchase, and its southern boundary had been expanded by the seizing of Florida from Spain. By 1845 the United States had grown to include the territory of Texas, as well as the Oregon territory. In response, the immigration policies of the United States were modified in order to promote settlement of these new territories. From 1800 - 1850, emigration from Europe increased greatly. This expansion in immigration was the result of various forms of social and political upheaval in Europe. From 1820 -1860 95% of immigrants in the United States originated from northern Europe. From the 1830s to the 1850s the total number of immigrants to the United States rose from approximately 151,000 to 1.7 million. The majority of these immigrants were Irish, German, and British. Emigration from China to the west coast also increased during this time period. by 1860 Chinese immigrants constituted approximately 25% of California's population. By 1882 Congress had passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which suspended all emigration from China. Concurrent to this exclusion, emigration from European countries was actively solicited by the United States via the Homestead Ace of 1862. This act granted land tracts to naturalized citizens for a nominal price of $1.25 per acre. In 1864 Congress passed the Act to Encourage Immigration, which established the office of Commissioner of Immigration and outlawed compulsory military service for male immigrants.", "This era is also known as the \"great wave\" of immigration. This is due to the enormous growth in immigration, which resulted in approximately 23 million immigrants settling in the United States. The majority of immigrants were from Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as Scandinavia. However, large numbers of immigrants were non-European. While pale in comparison to immigration from Europe, approximately one million immigrants arrived from Japan, Turkey, and Mexico. In addition, non-Protestant religious groups, including Catholics and Jews immigrated to the United States during this time period. Immigration during the industrial era was not merely a result of favorable policies enacted by the United States government, but also of political unrest, discrimination, and fragile economies in the immigrants' home countries. \nThis era is also marked by the increase in anti-immigration reactions and xenophobia. Controls on immigration were proposed in Congress and there was a concurrent rise in anti-immigrant actions and demonstrations. The rate of immigration slowed briefly in the 1890s, dropping from approximately 5.2 million immigrants to 3.6 million. However, by 1910 immigration had increased to 9 million. This was followed by a constriction of immigration in the first two decades before the era of the World Wars. The Dillingham Commission released a lengthy study of the immigrant question, which differentiated between \"desirable\" and \"undesirable\" immigrants, based upon ethnicity, race, and religion, with northern European Protestants being favored over southern or eastern European Catholics and Jews, with non-European immigrants considered highly undesirable. The Immigration Act of 1917 implemented many of the recommendations of the Dillingham Commission and created the requirement of a literacy test for immigrants.", "The first two decades of the 20th century ushered in a dramatic shift of attitude toward immigration, ending the era of mass immigration in the United States. Multiple national and international events coalesced into an increasing sense of nationalism and racial and class demarcations within American society. This nationalism greatly influenced the legislative endeavors of Congress, resulting in two acts that would set the tone for immigration in the United States. This tone has continued to the present. \nThe early 20th century is marked by the mass geo-political upheaval, exemplified by the Russian Revolution. This unrest influenced the social and political policy towards immigration in the United States. Europe experienced destabilization from multiple arenas, including the demise of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. World War I erupted after many years of unrest in the Balkans. In Italy, the destabilization of the economy resulting from the 1861 unification continued. Italian immigrants totaled 3.2 million from 1901 - 1920. Immigration from the Austro-Hungarian Empire totaled three million from 1901 - 1920 and approximately 2.7 million people immigrated from Russia during the same time period. This number of non-Protestant, non-northern European immigrants, along with the political upheaval capped by the inclusion of the United States into international politics during World War I, created a nationalistic and xenophobic back lash in the United States.

However, Congress has continued to disagree on comprehensive immigration reform, effectively moving some major policy decisions into the executive and judicial branches of government and fueling debate in the halls of state and municipal governments.\nFormer President Donald Trump has put efforts to reshape asylum, border, and deportation policy at the center of his political movement. President Joe Biden had pledged to reverse Trump\u2019s first-term actions and reform the system, but the end of pandemic-related border restrictions and a historic surge in migration have complicated his plans.\n## What is the immigrant population in the United States?\nImmigrants composed an estimated of the U.S. population in 2022, amounting to roughly 46 million people out of a total of almost 335 million, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released in April 2024. Together, immigrants and their U.S.-born children made up about 27 percent of U.S. inhabitants, per the Current Population Survey.

Other major countries of origin include India (6 percent); China, including Hong Kong and Macau (5 percent); and the Philippines (4 percent).", "The U.S. government estimated the undocumented population to be some eleven million people in 2022. This total represents a slight decrease from 11.8 million before the [PDF], which led some immigrants to return to their home countries and discouraged others from coming to the United States. In fiscal year 2023 (FY 2023), Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehended nearly 2.5 million people trying to illegally cross the southern U.S. border, a record high.\nUntil 2013, almost all of those trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border were Mexican citizens, and most were individuals seeking work. Between 2013 and 2021, most immigrants came from Asia, particularly China and India. Mexico has since regained its status as the top country of origin, and Central Americans have [made up an increasingly larger share](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/central-american-immigrants-united-states \"made up an increasingly larger share\") of migrants at the southern U.S. border. Generally, they are coming not for work but to make asylum claims, and many of them are unaccompanied children. Some of these immigrants have different legal rights from Mexican nationals in the United States: Under a 2008 anti\u2013human trafficking law, unaccompanied minors from noncontiguous countries have a right to a hearing before being deported to their home countries. The increase in Central American migration has strained the U.S. immigration system.

This global leadership in innovation has been attributable in part to America\u2019s unparalleled ability to attract rich and diverse talent from all over the world.\nImmigrant stories of success and innovation are woven intrinsically into the fabric of American history. For example, Sergey Brin escaped the Soviet Union, co-founded Google, and changed the way the world processed information; Katalin Karik\u00f3, an immigrant from Hungary, co-developed the mRNA vaccine technology that helped the United States and the world respond to the COVID-19 pandemic; and Levi Strauss, a Bavarian immigrant, created the quintessentially American blue jeans. Several major tech and telecommunications companies are led or founded by immigrants, and immigrants founded or co-founded an estimated 60 percent of the top U.S.-based artificial intelligence (AI) companies. Yet this dominance in innovation is being threatened by the Trump administration\u2019s shortsighted anti-immigration policies.", "The administration has sought to undermine the legal immigration system to fulfill its anti-immigration agenda, which hurts the U.S. economy and flies in the face of Americans\u2019 growing support for legal immigration. These unprecedented actions\u2014including detaining international students for expressing their opinions, revoking visas, attacking higher education institutions, and issuing new travel restrictions\u2014have sent warning signals to prospective international students, researchers, and innovators worldwide that the United States is not a place that welcomes their skills to build their careers and strengthen the American economy. The administration\u2019s actions are having negative impacts across the country, including reducing Americans\u2019 ability to access physicians by preventing foreign doctors from coming to the United States; threatening the educational and social benefits and billions in economic contributions that international students bring to the United States each year; and pushing the world\u2019s brightest to seek a future in other countries to study, research, and work.", "These anti-immigration policies exacerbate the Trump administration\u2019s broader attacks on American innovation. While the administration makes boastful claims about making America\u2019s economy more powerful, its actions are actually hurting U.S. innovation. The administration is making devastating cuts to federal funding for scientific research and development (R&D) and attempting to freeze funding for colleges and universities, rather than prioritizing solutions that spur innovation and prepare American workers for new types of work. In addition, the administration has falsely framed its immigration policies as seeking to serve the interests of American workers. Overall, through its anti-immigration rhetoric, restrictive policies, and unchecked use of power, along with other anti-worker policies, the Trump administration is weakening America\u2019s long-term competitiveness and jeopardizing jobs and opportunities for American workers.\nThis report examines the Trump administration\u2019s actions targeting talented immigrants and the avenues that allow them to work in the United States, underscoring the crucial role that immigrants play in strengthening America\u2019s leadership in innovation. The report explains the harmful consequences of the administration\u2019s anti-immigration actions on America\u2019s global strength in innovation by describing how the United States is ceding its power to attract global talent to other countries, chilling America\u2019s long-standing role as a beacon for current and future innovators, and harming America\u2019s AI leadership. Instead of restrictive, punitive policies that damage America\u2019s reputation and harm the U.S. economy, the country needs the executive branch to work with Congress to pursue smart policies that benefit American workers and create a better, modern legal immigration system for the United States that fosters innovation, incubates new ideas, supports cutting-edge research, and boosts America\u2019s competitive advantage.", "## The Trump administration\u2019s actions attacking legal immigration threaten American innovation\nImmigrants have made advances for U.S. innovation despite the country\u2019s archaic immigration system, which was last updated 35 years ago. However, instead of working with Congress to fix the system\u2019s flaws, the Trump administration has taken extreme steps to restrict legal immigration to the United States, threatening the future of American innovation. These actions are making it harder and less attractive for foreign nationals to come to the United States to study and contribute their work, skills, and ideas to critical industries.\n#### Targeting international students and researchers and restricting new arrivals\nThe Trump administration is targeting international students and researchers at universities across the country by going after their ability to lawfully study and work in the United States. For example, the U.S. Department of State has revoked more than 6,000 student visas. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has also attempted to terminate more than 4,700 Student Exchange and Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records of international students across the country in an effort to end their ability to lawfully study at American universities. Many of these students quickly piled up legal victories against the administration, as judges in multiple states put temporary restraining orders in place halting the administration\u2019s actions. Amid pressure, the administration reinstated the SEVIS records, effectively restoring the lawful status of thousands of affected students.", "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also detained multiple international students and researchers across the country for lawfully expressing their opinions. These detainees include R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, a Tufts University graduate student researching the relationship between social media and child development, who was detained for simply expressing views in an opinion piece in her college newspaper. A 25-year DHS veteran told he had \u201ctaken violent drug traffickers into custody with less overt intimidation and haste\u201d than the way \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was arrested. Federal Judge William G. Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, scathingly rebuked the Trump administration\u2019s unconstitutional actions against noncitizens such as \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, which he found were taken primarily \u201con account of their First Amendment protected political speech\u201d and sought to \u201cchill the rights to freedom of speech and peacefully to assemble.\u201d\n> \"The Trump administration\u2019s approach is to announce flashy policies that favor the wealthy without lifting a finger to actually fix the broken immigration system.\""]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "95669f34-ac2b-57ad-89ec-e5a01fab68da", "url": "https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/immigration-policies-can-win-public-support/", "title": "How pro-immigration policies can win public support in an era ...", "excerpts": ["Conversations about U.S. immigration policy are rife with conflict, but new research suggests a way to reconcile differences.

(Photo: Courtesy of Levy.)\nImmigration is one of the most divisive issues in modern politics across the globe, but new research suggests that support for expanding legal immigration may not be as intractable as it seems.\n, associate professor of political science at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, co-authored a , analyzed in a working paper posted to SSRN that surveyed more than 20,000 adults across nine liberal democracies in North America and Europe.\nThe study used a series of survey experiments to explore how people respond to different types of immigration policies. The central question: Can the of immigration policy shift public opinion \u2014 even among those who tend to oppose immigration in general?\nThe answer, it turns out, is yes.\nThe research found that even modest requirements appended to immigration policies \u2014 such as requiring newcomers to find employment or demonstrate basic language proficiency \u2014 can dramatically increase support for expanding immigration. The effects held across countries, political ideologies, and even in the face of counterarguments.\n  * Support increases significantly when immigration policies include basic integration requirements , like employment, language skills or background checks \u2014 , where support rose by as much as 15 percentage points in some cases and opposition cratered.", "* Specific policy requirements \u2014 like stipulating that immigrants must work or learn the language \u2014 were more persuasive than broadly positive statements about how legal immigrants, as a group, tend to integrate.\n  * Support held strong even when the immigrants were from stigmatized regions, such as the Middle East \u2014 _as long as the policies included basic integration requirements._\n  * Even when counterarguments were introduced , such as concerns about cultural assimilation or economic burden, support remained high if integration requirements were included, either about immigrants\u2019 employment or basic language proficiency.", "USC Dornsife News spoke with Levy to understand what these findings reveal about immigration opinion today and what they could mean for the future of policy design.\nWhy is it important to understand how to bridge the political divide over immigration?\nPublic frustration with illegal immigration and permissive, poorly administered asylum policies abounds in Europe and North America. Right-wing populists have capitalized on this discontent to vault from the margins to the forefront of electoral politics, scaring establishment parties out of their wits. Stalwart supporters of immigration are now on the defensive, eager to shed the image of out-of-touch \u201cglobalists\u201d by tightening asylum policy, getting tough on the border and slashing legal immigration levels.\nBut drastic cuts to immigration would be a disaster for these countries. Western societies are aging rapidly and face heightened global economic competition. Immigration spurs productivity and innovation, ensures prosperity and viable social safety nets, and \u2014 at least in the U.S. and Canada \u2014 embodies our heritage as lands of opportunity for those willing to work hard and adopt our core values.\nResponsible leaders must find ways to tailor and communicate about immigration policies that can bring these benefits without alienating voters who worry that immigration is out of control, burdensome or harmful to social cohesion. That is a hard task!\nYour research tested how people respond to specific immigration policy details. What kinds of requirements made the biggest difference?\nThe requirements that matter most across Canada, the U.S. and the seven Western European countries in our study are the most basic types of integration: getting a job and learning the language. These are things that most immigrants, in fact, already do \u2014 so structuring policies that encourage or mandate them would be feasible while preserving large-scale admissions.", "It\u2019s worth noting that while people especially support admitting more immigrants with advanced degrees and STEM backgrounds, the policies we tested included no requirements that prospective immigrants be \u201chighly skilled\u201d \u2014 and still won broad support.\nOne of your most striking findings was that people\u2019s opinions shifted even when their overall attitudes toward immigrants didn\u2019t. Why do you think that is?\nThere are often gaps in public opinion between abstract or general feelings about something and specific preferences about policies. Take, for example, political scientists\u2019 common depiction of Americans as \u201cphilosophically conservative and operationally liberal.\u201d What this means is that many people say they want smaller government but also support the very social programs and regulations that comprise most of the government\u2019s activities and expenditures.\nThis is because Americans\u2019 small-government ethos co-exists with support for the specific goals those government activities further \u2014 assisting the elderly and infirm, correcting market failures, promoting equal opportunity and so on.\nSimilarly, many people say they would like less immigration, but they also endorse many of the economic and humanitarian goals that specific immigration policies seek to achieve. In earlier work, we found that while large portions of the American public support reducing legal immigration levels, far smaller percentages support cuts to the number of immigrants admitted on the basis of family ties to U.S. citizens, employment or humanitarian need. These categories make up well over 90% of the green cards issued by the U.S. government.\nWhat we found in this study is that although people would prefer not to increase immigration in general, they can accept \u2014 or even support \u2014 policies that do so if they come with provisions that suggest immigrants will be productive and integral members of society.", "Many political messages try to win over the public by highlighting immigrants\u2019 positive contributions. But your study found that wasn\u2019t nearly as persuasive as policy requirements. What does that tell us?\nOne thing it tells us is that many people do not automatically connect general information about immigrants with their views on specific immigration policies. For example, someone may believe immigration has brought benefits in the past but worry that an increase in new immigration would hinder assimilation or let in a different kind of person \u2014 someone perceived to bring more risks and offer fewer benefits.\nMany people also have fairly developed attitudes about immigration, in general, that have taken shape over long periods and are thus hard to change. But a new policy proposal is closer to a blank slate, and people can learn about its content and make up their minds without preconceived notions or so much emotional baggage.\nThere may be ways to bolster support by highlighting the contributions of immigrants as a group, but the evidence is mixed at best, and such claims are inevitably met with negative counterarguments in public debate. The more direct route we examine is to propose policies with stipulations and requirements that directly address common concerns about integration.\nDid you see differences in how liberals and conservatives responded to these policy details?\nYes \u2014 enormous ones. While the policies we tested made both liberals and conservatives more supportive of immigration, the effects were significantly greater among conservatives, despite their much stronger baseline opposition to immigration in general.\nIn other words, these policies didn\u2019t just make liberals who already supported immigration more supportive \u2014 the biggest shift came from reducing opposition among people who aren\u2019t predisposed to view immigration positively."]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "4e2d8882-14a0-5a3a-9ccf-323d9d1796a8", "url": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9763793/", "title": "Immigration Politics and Policymaking in the USA (2017\u20132021)", "excerpts": ["A website belongs to an official government organization in the United States. \nSecure .gov websites use HTTPS A ( ) or means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

The dearth of scientific enquiry about the latter necessitated the present study. By analyzing individual-level data ( = 1018) obtained from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), we assess the effect of geopolitics\u2013red and blue states and other factors on public attitude towards six immigration policies in the USA (2017\u20132021). Overall, the results indicate a null relationship between geopolitics and public attitude towards immigration policies. Additionally, we observed several sociodemographic factors, such as age, political ideology, party affiliation, and region, influence public attitude towards immigration policies. Based on these results, it is recommended that immigration policies formulated and implemented in the USA must be based on empirical evidence and not sentiments.\nGeopolitics, Immigration Policy, Public Attitude, USA", "Each of the fifty states in the USA can be viewed or categorized as either red (republican) or blue (democrat) states based on electoral or voting patterns, majority political ideology, and the dominance of either the Republican or Democratic party in the state (Levendusky & Pope, ; Miller & Conover, ; Nivola & Brady, ; Rodden, ). Some studies refer to this phenomenon as geopolitics\u2014the intersection of politics and geography (Davisson, ; May & McGarvey, ).\nAlthough some previous studies have examined the association between geopolitics and public attitude towards immigration policy in the USA, the results are inconsistent and inconclusive (Bessett et al., ; May & McGarvey, ; Stanhope et al., ). Thus, it leads to calls for further investigation to bring nuance and augment the existing findings (Stanhope et al., ).\nStudies examining the relationship between geopolitics and public attitude towards immigration policy in the USA can be broadly summarized into three categories. First, studies that focus on examining the association between an individual state and public attitude towards immigration policy (Lee et al., ). Second, studies that focus on examining the association between a group or bloc of states\u2014Midwest, Northeast, and Southern states\u2014and public attitude towards immigration policy (Sanders & Heineman, ). Third, studies that focus on examining the effect of electoral or voting pattern, and the dominance of either the Republican or Democratic party in the state\u2014geopolitics\u2014on public attitude towards immigration policy (Bessett et al., ; May & McGarvey, ).", "The first two studies are commonplace in the extant literature compared to the third group of studies which are not because of the lack of scientific enquiry using this approach. Thus, it creates a gap in the existing literature that requires further investigation and the attention of researchers. Additionally, findings from geopolitics studies are mixed and require further investigation not only to augment the extant literature but also to add nuance to the findings.\nTherefore, against this background, the present study seeks to add to the existing literature on the effect of geopolitics on public attitude towards immigration policy in the USA while addressing some of the existing gaps in the literature. To accomplish this goal, we analyzed 1018 responses obtained from the Public Religion Research Institute guided by six research questions, namely:\n  * Research Question 1: What is the effect of geopolitics on public attitude towards laws and policies that separate parents from children at the border?\n  * Research Question 2: What is the effect of geopolitics on public attitude towards accepting refugees and immigrants facing danger in their home countries in the USA?\n  * Research Question 3: What is the effect of geopolitics on public attitude towards making conditions difficult for undocumented immigrants, so they return to their home country?\n  * Research Question 4: What is the effect of geopolitics on public attitude towards building a wall against immigrants in the USA?\n  * Research Question 5: What is the effect of geopolitics on public attitude towards laws preventing immigrants from entering the USA?\n  * Research Question 6: What is the effect of geopolitics on public attitude towards police stops targeted at undocumented immigrants with criminal background?", "Overall, assessing the effect of geopolitics on public attitude towards six different immigration policies has several theoretical and policy implications. Theoretically, it augments previous studies seeking to understand the effect of geopolitics on immigration while adding nuance to the existing knowledge. Thus, the present study addresses a void in the present literature. Policy-wise, the present study sheds light on not just the effect of geopolitics on immigration but also on how citizens formulate their views and opinions that might apply to other policy issues and areas. Finally, the present study also reveals the effect of other factors on public attitude towards immigration policies in the USA.\nWe analyzed individual-level data of 1018 respondents (407 interviewed by landline and 611 interviewed by cellphones) obtained from the June 2018 national representative survey of adults 18 + years in the USA on immigration by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). Using empirical evidence from the extant literature, the variables that influence public attitude towards immigration policies in the USA were categorized into the following variables: geopolitics, group conflict/instrumental group conflict, demographic contact/intergroup, political, sociodemographic characteristics of the public, and others.\n### Geopolitics, Public Attitude, Immigration Policies/Laws"]}, {"neutral_name": null, "uuid": "4aa3c6fc-31f1-5624-b12b-c17f028156fb", "url": "https://about.bgov.com/insights/federal-policy/a-guide-to-immigration-policy-changes-in-2025/", "title": "A Guide to Immigration Policy Changes in 2025", "excerpts": ["# A Guide to Immigration Policy Changes in 2025\nU.S. immigration continues to be one of the most hotly contested issues on the Hill and in statehouses across the country because it impacts a wide swath of communities in every corner of America.\nFor more than a decade, high-profile members of Congress \u2013 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2013 have called for changes to border policy, but disagree on how to get there and what success looks like.

And as immigrants continue to enter and remain in the country, and participate in the workforce, people on both sides of the aisle are seeking certain outcomes.", "For instance, those in favor of pathways to citizenship say immigration reform is necessary, in part, because immigration has long been a source of strength for the country \u2013 but especially now, as the youngest baby boomers near retirement age and the workforce continues to age. Meanwhile, those who support the deportations of immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally may want to toughen related laws as they argue in favor of border reform.\nThat said, no matter which side of the aisle you or your clients are on, government affairs professionals must stay on top of U.S. immigration policies (both proposed and passed) as well as related news on the topic.\nEnter Bloomberg Government\u2019s all-in-one platform, which helps public affairs professionals gain access to timely resources, tools, and deep analysis to help them understand the landscape and how immigration reform may impact key business sectors.\n## Current state of immigration in the United States\nThe U.S. immigration system that we have today is the result of several major legislative reforms. The first reform of significance was the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which was first codified in 1952 and has been amended significantly several times since, with Congress making these amendments based on new public laws.\n### Overview of U.S. immigration policies\nImmigration reforms in early U.S. history include:\n  * The 1790 Naturalization Act, which excluded non-white people from having eligibility to naturalize\n  * 1798\u2019s Alien Friends Act, which authorized the president to imprison or deport any so-called \u201calien\u201d who was deemed dangerous to the U.S., making it the first act to authorize deportation for immigrants\n  * The Naturalization Act of 1870, which extended eligibility for naturalization to people of African nativity or descent", "* The Immigration Act of 1903, which banned beggars, anarchists, and importers of prostitutes (and was the first U.S. law to restrict immigration based on a person\u2019s political beliefs)", "Speeding forward several decades, after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1952, additional reforms include:\n  * The 1965 amendment to the INA, which ended the national origins quota system that had disproportionately favored European immigrants and set the stage for current immigration policies that focus on the reunification of families and the needs of the nation\u2019s employers\n  * The Refugee Act of 1980, which adopted the United Nation\u2019s definition of \u201crefugees\u201d and expanded the annual admission of refugees\n  * The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which created a path to citizenship for people who\u2019d entered the United States without permission before 1982 but also made it illegal for employers to knowingly hire people who are undocumented\n  * The Immigration Act of 1990, which increased the number of people who could legally immigrate to the U.S. and provided Temporary Protected Status so asylum seekers could stay in the U.S. until conditions in their home countries improved\n  * The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program created by former President Barack Obama in 2012, which allowed certain young immigrants without status, who were brought to the United States as children, to apply for work authorization permits and protection from immediate deportation. The Trump administration ended DACA in 2017, but the federal courts \u2013 including the U.S. Supreme Court \u2013 have kept the program in place and the Biden administration published updated regulations in 2022.", "Today, U.S. immigration policy is governed largely by the Immigration and Nationality Act. This current U.S. policy has two major aspects: the first \u201cfacilitates migration flows of foreign nationals into the United States\u201d and the second \u201cfocuses on immigration enforcement and removal,\u201d as the U.S. Congress confirms in its .\nWhen Congress enacts public laws that affect immigration and nationality, it may amend INA sections or add new sections to the INA, or it may pass laws that do not change the INA, as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has confirmed.\nNotably, the U.S. also makes permanent immigration a different issue than temporary immigration, and the executive branch is allowed to \u201cexercise statutory or executive authority to allow certain noncitizens to enter or remain in the United States on a time-limited basis, including those who have not been admitted through permanent or temporary pathways under the INA and might otherwise be subject to removal,\u201d with these pathways including TPS and immigration parole, according to Congress.\nAnd as U.S. immigration laws are carried out by several executive branch departments and agencies, these agencies have authority for immigration enforcement via the INA, including \u201crestricting entry to and removing persons from the United States who lack authorization to be in the country or who have such authorization but have committed acts that make them subject to removal,\u201d according to Congress.\nMigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border in Juarez, Mexico, in December 2024.
